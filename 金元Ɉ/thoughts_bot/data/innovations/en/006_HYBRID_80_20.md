# Hybrid Architecture 80/20

**Servers + Humans = Consensus**
**Montana Protocol v1.0**

---

## Abstract

Montana uses a unique hybrid architecture: 80% of consensus weight belongs to servers (Full Node), 20% to humans (Verified User). Servers provide stability and performance. Humans provide decentralization and censorship resistance.

**Key formula:**
```
Consensus = 80% Servers (stability) + 20% Humans (decentralization)
```

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem with Pure Models

| Model | Example | Problem |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Servers only | Traditional DB | Centralization, censorship |
| Miners only | Bitcoin | Pools = centralization |
| Stakers only | PoS networks | Rich-get-richer |
| **80/20 Hybrid** | **Montana** | **Balance** |

### 1.2 Montana Solution

Separate responsibilities:
- **Servers** — fast, reliable, always online
- **Humans** — distributed, independent, censorship-resistant

---

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Two Node Tiers

**Source code:** [consensus.rs](https://github.com/efir369999/junomontanaagibot/blob/main/Montana%20ACP/montana/src/consensus.rs)

```rust
pub const FULL_NODE_CAP_PERCENT: u64 = 80;
pub const VERIFIED_USER_CAP_PERCENT: u64 = 20;
```

### 2.2 Tier Comparison

| Parameter | Full Node (80%) | Verified User (20%) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Interval | τ₁ (1 min) | 10-40 min (random) |
| Verification | Key only | Key + FIDO2 |
| Hardware | Server 24/7 | Phone/laptop |
| Role | Stability | Decentralization |

---

## 3. Why 80/20?

### 3.1 Pareto Principle

```
80% of result = 20% of effort
80% stability = servers
20% decentralization = enough for censorship resistance
```

### 3.2 Consensus Attack

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| All servers captured | 20% humans block consensus |
| All humans offline | 80% servers work (degraded mode) |
| 51% servers + 0% humans | No consensus (need >50% from both) |

---

## 4. Attack Protection

| Attack | Defense |
|--------|---------|
| Server capture | 20% humans are independent |
| Sybil via humans | FIDO2 + Adaptive Cooldown |
| Censorship | Geographically distributed humans |
| Operator corruption | Humans not linked to operators |

---

## 5. Scientific Novelty

1. **Formalized hybrid** — exact 80/20 percentages in protocol
2. **Role separation** — servers ≠ humans by function
3. **Dual threshold** — consensus requires both tiers
4. **Anti-fragile** — attack on one tier strengthens the other
