# Atemporal Coordinate Presence (ACP)

**Montana Protocol**

## Core Idea

ACP is a consensus mechanism where temporal presence replaces computational work. Time cannot be accelerated or parallelized. 14 days of presence requires 14 days — equally for everyone.

---

## Physical Constraints

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Time is ordered | Presence accumulates monotonically |
| Time is observable | Network can attest positions |
| Communication is bounded | Messages propagate with delay |
| Time is uniform | NTS sources provide synchronization |

---

## Time Units

| Symbol | Duration | Role |
|--------|----------|------|
| τ₂ | 10 minutes | Minimum slice interval |
| Ɉ | 1 second | Base temporal unit |

---

## Attack Resistance

| Attack | ACP Defense |
|--------|-------------|
| Sybil | Temporal cost |
| 51% | Presence majority |
| Nothing-at-stake | Adaptive cooldown |

---

## Conclusion

Time is the only resource distributed equally. It cannot be bought, accelerated, or pre-accumulated.
