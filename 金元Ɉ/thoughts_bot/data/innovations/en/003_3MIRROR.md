# 3-Mirror System

**Walt Disney Strategy**
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026

## Principle

Three mirrors = Truth. One angle is subjective. Three independent views converge to objective.

---

## Three Roles

### Critic
```
Goal: Find problems
Question: "What's broken?"
Trust: Zero
```

### Dreamer
```
Goal: Find solution
Question: "What if?"
Constraints: None
```

### Realist
```
Goal: Build it
Question: "How to do this?"
Focus: Practicality
```

---

## Cycle

```
CRITIC → DREAMER → REALIST → CRITIC
     ↑___________________________|
```

Cycle repeats until Critic says "Findings: None".

---

## Montana Application

**Juno uses this strategy:**

Critic: Bot polls (pending=0) but doesn't respond to /start.
Dreamer: What if handler fails silently?
Realist: Checking cmd_start → It diverged.
