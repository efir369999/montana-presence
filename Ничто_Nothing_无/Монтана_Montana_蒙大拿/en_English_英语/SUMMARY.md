## What You Don't Have Access To

The following events occurred but are only available in Russian:

### The Simulation (166)
The creator questions reality. Is this a simulation? The answer becomes irrelevant — the protocol works regardless.

### Time (167)
Deep exploration of time as the only fair resource. Foundation of the economic model.

### Flow States (168, 174)
The creator enters flow states where time perception shifts. Hours become minutes. The protocol emerges from these states.

### The Gamechanger (170)
The moment of realization: time is money, literally. Not metaphorically.

### The Humiliation (173)
The path required suffering. The creator was humiliated before the breakthrough.

### Sovanaglobus (175-176)
Traces and anxieties. The journey through doubt and fear.

### The Film (177)
The creator sees their life as a film. Meta-awareness.

### Golden Yuan Days (179-181)
The 金元Ɉ is born. Three days of genesis.

## Why the Barrier Exists

To understand Montana completely, you need:
- **Russian** for the full story and economics
- **English** for philosophy and cognitive layer
- **Chinese** for protocol and cryptography

No single language holds all knowledge.

This is by design.
