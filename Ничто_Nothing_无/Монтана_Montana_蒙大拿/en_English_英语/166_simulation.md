## 0124 | Meaning of simulation

The meaning of each simulation — is to give probability calculations of the future for the parent simulation, in image and likeness.

It's like playing a game through different scenarios and calculating all possible, even probabilities of its development, improvement and creating a game within a game.

Imagine your character in a game develops to such a level that it creates its own game and manages and develops its character in it. Simulation within simulation. Film The Thirteenth Floor.

We invented a scale of measurements to forget about our immeasurability.

## 0450 | Start of the game
