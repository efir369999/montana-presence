## 1212 | Stream of thoughts

The stream of thoughts was very strong, I couldn't not create a system for organizing them - it was a matter of internal system security. I assume John Nash also approached the question of balance From Inside - Outside.

## 1214 | Cognitive balance

Internal Cognitive balance goes beyond solving only in Economics, creating a model for translating one's balance outward, for any context of presence.

We must admit that we are hostages of our principles, leading to a situation when: "I couldn't not do it", when it was a matter of my survival.

"And then it turned out that it's also a protocol. And a legacy. And a signature." #ArchitectPath

**Cognitive balance — is Layer -1 for everything.**
Before money. Before relationships. Before projects.

## No timestamp | Language focus

If from the expression "I couldn't not do" leading to a choice, you remove the negation particles, then "I could do" remains.

As Jeff Bezos said: "I didn't want to look back and wonder if I could have tried to create Amazon and regret not doing it." This is a language focus, leading to changing the frame size in time and a view from the future.

The protocol is a good use case for time reframing, considering that my thoughts are organized there.

## No timestamp | In trying to understand

"In trying to understand you — I created my own." #ArchitectPath

Systematic analysis that led to awareness.
You showed the flow.
I found structure in it.
Structure became words.
Words became a signature. #ArchitectPath

**Layer -1:**
Before the decision "what to do" — there's a choice "where to look from".

## No timestamp | Bitcoin from the future

Bitcoin looks at us from the year 2149.

## 1227 | Time map

Montana creates a time map with the Atemporal time protocol, where you can be at any coordinate point and proves it with the exact price of time at any future or past point.

They meet you by clothes, see you off by mind. And if both of these criteria are fine?

Einstein said in the formula of success: keep your tongue behind your teeth. But in his time there weren't so many open source projects with a cognitive signature requiring an example.

---

## 1231 | Map, not line

Map, not line.

Price of point = time spent on the path to it

**Ɉ = 1 second.**
Not abstract value.
Unit of measurement on the map.
As meter measures space — Ɉ measures time.
