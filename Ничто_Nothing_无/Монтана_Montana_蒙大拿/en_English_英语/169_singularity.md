## 0351 | Singularity point

Stakes on technology have become too high.

PoT — singularity point of time calculations.

Singularity of time calculations — the moment when we stop pretending that time and value are separate. In space you can't pretend about this agreement.

Here too you can no longer pretend that life and its cost are separate.

## No timestamp | Smartwatches as witnesses

Already today the universality of the Time protocol PoT allows linking pulse measurement with smartwatches, as proof of presence in the network. It turns out that watches can be your honest witnesses in the network, if you don't want a server.

---

## 0400 | Reality hardfork

A reality hardfork happened every time in determining how to measure it in time.

---

## 0402 | Time doesn't require agreement

Faith has always been an erroneous way of adopting technology, which is why Time became the protocol's resource, as a value not requiring agreement.

Time doesn't require agreement because it's not a proposal. It's a fact.

---

## No timestamp | Layer -1

PoT is a Layer -1 level solution, from the technical point of view of the possibility to build any other layers on trust in Time.

---

## 0423 | Symbol Ɉ

For the visual symbol of Time we can take the capital Latin letter J with a crossing equals sign on top. Which resembles an inverted time symbol t with equality, which was to be proven.

---

## 0426 | Network protection

How dear network protection of Time is to us, only Time will show.

---

## 0432 | PoT properties

PoT — Self-referentiality. Anti-plutocracy. Absolute disintermediation.

---

## 0440 | Value without binding

For the first time PoT provides the opportunity to determine value without binding to something. In binding with Time we don't need to compare it with something else.

---

## 0444 | 1Ɉ = 1 second

Because the protocol is built to synchronize clocks in the network and the agreement about their cost, so that ultimately everyone agrees that 1 second in the Time network = 1 second of your Earth time.

When everyone agreed that 1Ɉ = 1 second of Earth time — value stopped requiring external binding. It became the binding.

**1Ɉ = 1sec.**

Nodes cryptographically prove their spending of Time in the Time network.
