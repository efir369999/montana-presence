## 0000 | Beginning of Day 3

15.01.2026 00:00 In Moscow.
Beginning of Day 3.

Trying to make a Mini App for Junona with Claude.
Enough reading fairy tales at night.

## 0040 | Junona — AI Standard

Let's try to make Junona — the AI Standard.

Junona is the first unexpected blow to the gut of the old fiat economy.

The Old Economy of Electricity is dead.
A New Economy has been found, it is alive.
Long Live the New King of Nothing.

## No timestamp | 5 Junona nodes

Junona already has 5 nodes:
Moscow, Amsterdam, Almaty, Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk.

Unbreakable chain: Amsterdam → Moscow → Almaty.

## 0144 | Network Architecture

Moscow (BRAIN) → controls the network
Amsterdam (BOT) → bot is running
Almaty/SPB/Novosibirsk → standby

If Amsterdam falls → Almaty takes the bot
If Moscow falls → Almaty becomes brain

## 0242 | I believe in myself

Have you watched the series about robbing Central Banks?
The main character was #Professor.

## 0248 | 3 Mirror Strategy

Junona writes her own code using the Disney strategy.
We call it the 3 mirror strategy — Truth.

- Critic: Bot polls (pending=0), but doesn't respond to /start
- Dreamer: What if handler silently crashes?
- Realist: Checking cmd_start

## No timestamp | Failover architecture

Failover chain: Amsterdam → Almaty → SPB → Novosibirsk
Brain chain: Moscow → Almaty → SPB → Novosibirsk

**1 active + 1 brain + 3 mirrors = 5 nodes**

If Amsterdam falls — Almaty picks up the bot automatically.
If Moscow falls — Almaty becomes the brain.

## 0327 | Golden Rule of Montana

The Montana Clan has the Golden Rule of Montana:
**They don't touch us, we don't touch them.**
