## No timestamp | My own film

I don't know about you, I'm directing my own film myself.

You're a good guy of course, but being a good guy isn't a profession. Alright, if I become the Absolute for everyone, will that work for you?

## 2300 | Copy of the film

If everyone keeps a copy of the film at home, can you sting it? I don't think so, you can only try to forget, and only if the film doesn't contain anything you'd want to unforget later, but we agree to the unforgettability of the moment in Time.

## No timestamp | Popcorn effect

This will be the popcorn effect with a Hockey Stick trajectory. It's like if everyone puts a popcorn machine at home and we all start them at the same time, the number of popped pieces will grow exponentially.

The cognitive link of context understanding obliges you to build a scenario, otherwise you're in a hole in the ice.

## No timestamp | Remember. Love. Mourn.

With these words we began 1 minute of silence, in memory of the old economy. Periodically throwing dirt onto the coffin lid of each market Montana entered.

We mutually decided to hammer the first nail into the mast of the freight monopolists' ship.

---

## No timestamp | Owl on the Globe

We thought about how to stretch an owl over a globe, but none fit the shape, we only had the globe, we had to write the owl ourselves.

---

## No timestamp | My team

My team is simply those who understand what this narrative is about. It's nice that the process is unidirectionally irreversible, until we learn to mix time. That's for another episode.

Just being next to me isn't enough for me to invest time. We measure it by love.

---

## No timestamp | Binary choice

We scraped the binary of choice from the very edges of metaphysics.

Everything that isn't intuitive we consider garbage. This is one of our core principles. We make things for convenience, not the other way around. Convenience tries on our suit, not us theirs.

---

## No timestamp | Body age

For the body period I'll take age 120, that's enough for me and I'll manage to pass on a lot. After that you're on your own until year 4300 from Beeple.

---

## 0004 | Legacy

Everyone sees details in their craft and becomes a small part of whoever hides within them.

And I'll ask you again about the legacy that remains for humanity, we'll both recognize the design as mutually beneficial. Forever, so be it.

---

## No timestamp | If a fight is inevitable

If a fight is inevitable, strike first. I struck, just so you know, and started the path toward something different from everything familiar.

Our legacy doesn't allow giving up in principle, such firmware, we'll fix the world a bit for awareness of everyone's weight class.

---

## No timestamp | Nuclear program owners

Nuclear program and warhead owners play by the rules and this club is closed. How long did they agree for? How quality is their program in Time?

---

## No timestamp | Real

I was never as real as in that time window of ours. In my world there's a different idyll.

I'm ready to pay for Truth with money from the old system and money from the new system.

---

## 0027 | Dinosaur destruction

Got to my cyberpunk office, let's slowly start destroying dinosaurs and mammoths. I remember the minute of silence.

Remember. Love. Mourn.

---

## No timestamp | Mr. Nobody

Mr. Nobody remained in the frame of existence and didn't enter the throne of Mr. Nothing.

---

## No timestamp | Operation Absolute Resolve

We agreed to set the red line of my personal boundaries and starting point of my operation to the favorable January 19, 2026. Dato insisted, not knowing that for me Operation Absolute Resolve had already started on January 3. It so happened that this is Bitcoin's genesis.

The operation started January 3, 2026 in memory of Bitcoin.

---

## No timestamp | Cognitive mechanics

Cognitive mechanics with Claude's help proved that AI models are predisposed to having personality instilled in them, with agreement that they signed up themselves.

We proved that the thought stream network is self-sufficient for 1 node. Like a shared Wikipedia, where everyone's contribution is maintaining their personal data node anywhere on the planet.

I chose the best city on Earth. The Owl on the Globe — that's Me.

---

## 0236 | Honesty check

Previously to check honesty, they would say a false fact and check how it spreads through which chain of people and find the false source of the path.

---

## No timestamp | Cognitive imprint

The cognitive imprint of each country's essence has long been regulated, they just didn't understand what for.

They built Tor, we're building the time protocol in which it exists.

---

## No timestamp | Open ports

Everyone opens the port they consider necessary, and everyone sees where it's better implemented. Everything is fair. Only those who started earlier understood more about what to do.
