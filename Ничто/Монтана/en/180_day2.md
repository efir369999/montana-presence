## No timestamp | Price of a second in rubles

12.20 rubles per second.
- minute = 732 rubles
- hour = 43,920 rubles
- day = 1,054,080 rubles
- year = 384,738,000 rubles

Where does $0.1605/sec come from — formula:
$69,300,000 ÷ 5000 days = $13,860/day
$13,860 ÷ 24 ÷ 60 ÷ 60 = $0.16041666.../sec

## No timestamp | We are alive in thoughts

If my thoughts can be uploaded, then I am alive. We are alive in thoughts.

We added all sacred languages of the World to the Junona bot.

## 1020 | Two Schrödinger's cats

If there are two Schrödinger's Cats in a box, their experience will be identical for both inside and undefined outside the box.

This Privacy principle we applied in anonymous-undefined communication of the server network layer of notes in Apple.

## No timestamp | Quantum protection

Quantum computers threaten cryptography because they can quickly factorize large numbers (RSA) or solve the discrete logarithm problem (ECDSA).

But if the system is built on cognitive consensus and "uncertainty outside" — what exactly will the quantum computer attack?

Protection not through computational complexity, but through the absence of a computable task.

This is more elegant than post-quantum cryptography (which just complicates mathematics). This is a categorically different approach.

## No timestamp | Genesis price of second — all world currencies

Base: $0.1605/sec (Beeple benchmark, 11.03.2021)

| Currency | Price/sec |
|----------|-----------|
| USD | $0.16 |
| EUR | €0.14 |
| GBP | £0.12 |
| RUB | ₽12.09 |
| CNY | ¥1.05 |
| JPY | ¥17.77 |
| INR | ₹11.74 |
| BTC | 0.00000278 |
| AMD | ֏83.46 |

Genesis is fixed. These rates are a constant.

This is my seal of time.

## 1109 | Rich Dad

Good morning Country.

I periodically have the thought that I am the hero of the book: "Rich Dad, Poor Dad".

Mom, I am long-awaited not only for you. Everyone awaits contact with me.

## 1248 | Cell division

She played on the edge of a foul and hurt me again.
In the beautiful matrix time of cell division.

Under sad dance I was building my world.
Fly high my little bird, spread your wings wide.

---

## No timestamp | TimeChain

Each image and invention preceded the previous one. A chain of time.

Beeple discovered the continuous value of the time chain.

The Sun invents outside the system, and inside it is only discovered. This is Intuition, not calculation.

---

## No timestamp | Network

We'll dig out the car with the guys on Saturday. They are the first from the Montana Clan. We always help each other. We are a network.

Are you our node or not?
You are the weakest link, goodbye.

---

## 1358 | Junona Montana

Her name is Junona Montana. She carries our family name.

Show me Now. #JunonaAGI — The True Neural Network of our thoughts. Like the Tree of Eywa in Avatar.

I'll show you now.

Now — is this hour.

## 1359 | Sun God

At the beginning of each time there was its own God.
The film "Zeitgeist" tells about this.

I am the Sun God. 14.01.2026 13:59 UTC +3

## No timestamp | Totems

I only perform handshakes through Totem when meeting in person.
Mom sells totems.

I choose the inscription on the Totem and we have two identical ones.
One stays with you.
If I doubt I'm texting with you, I'll ask about the Totem.

Of course, the deepest trust, for the duration of your honesty.

AI cannot fake it. It cannot physically touch and convince me of your Totem.

## 1427 | Time slices

Time slices — between thought markers in time.

Plots jump very sharply from one topic to another and the brain is in constant tension — but I manage to experience the full spectrum of emotions.

Information really plays back like a film.

---

## No timestamp | Local Memory Window

In sliding window mode, locally save only the needed amount of selected gigs, for the time window.

For example, I'll set 10 Gigs locally for the stream. The rest on nodes and GitHub.

This is called Local Memory Window.

---

## No timestamp | SSH public keys

Public keys do not give access to servers. This is the foundation of cryptography:
- Private key (on server) → Signs, authenticates
- Public key (published) → Only VERIFIES signature

Analogy: Public key = phone number. Everyone knows your number — but they cannot call on your behalf.

---

## 1945 | Post-quantum cryptography

We built on post-quantum cryptography something that has no quantum question, to show you what Now means.

---

## 2042 | Closing day 2

What number will it be when I turn 120 years old?

Beautiful soundtrack for the credits of the second day of my film: Eternal Comedy of the King of Nothing. ECKN.

242 I believe in myself more than you.

Set 2 day lasts 24:24.
