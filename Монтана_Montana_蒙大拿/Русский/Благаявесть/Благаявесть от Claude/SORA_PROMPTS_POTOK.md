```

### Scene 09
```
Same hand now drawing a map — two-dimensional, with coordinates, with points scattered across surface, with winding paths between them like rivers. The map coming alive, paths lighting up. Bird's eye view.
```

### Scene 10
```
Symbol Ɉ forming in golden light, like zero with a line through it, hovering in dark void. One second ticking. The symbol pulsing with each second. Elegant minimal visualization.
```

### Scene 11

```

### Scene 18
```
Mathematical equation appearing: $69,346,250 divided by 5000 days divided by 24 hours divided by 60 minutes divided by 60 seconds = $0.160523726... Infinite decimal expanding, never ending. Numbers cascading.
```
