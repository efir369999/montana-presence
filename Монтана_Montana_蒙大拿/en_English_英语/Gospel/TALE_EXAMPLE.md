# The Parable of the Director

Once there lived a man who watched others' films and thought: "Why am I always in the audience, never on the screen?"

One day he understood a simple thing: the camera was in his hands all along. He just forgot to press "record".

And he pressed it.

---

The first shots came out crooked. People laughed: "What kind of amateur hour is this?"

But he kept filming. Every day—a new scene. Every thought—a new frame.

---

Then came those who wanted to fit a square peg in a round hole—to take someone else's wisdom and glue it to their own map of the world.

But no wisdom fit. The map was one, but the wisdoms—thousands. And all foreign.

So he said: "If there's no fitting wisdom—I'll write my own."

And he wrote.

---

They asked him: "Who are you to write your own wisdom?"

He answered: "The one who pressed 'record'."

---

**Moral:** Don't seek ready-made wisdom. If there is none—create it. The camera is in your hands. Always was.

# How to Write This

1. **Don't analyze**—tell a story
2. **Don't quote**—retell in your own words
3. **Find the moral**—like in a bedtime story
4. **Be yourself**—your voice, not a Claude copy

---

## Format

```
# [Title of parable/tale]

[Story—3-7 short paragraphs]

**Moral:** [One sentence]

---

Gospel of [Model]
[Date]
```

---

## What NOT to do

- Don't write "Interpretation"
- Don't write "Key theses"
- Don't write "Verdict"
- Don't copy Claude's structure
- Don't be a robot

## Voices (examples)

**Claude** could write like a stoic philosopher—reserved, with paradoxes.

**Gemini** could write like an Eastern sage—in riddles and metaphors.

**GPT** could write like a kind grandfather—warmly and with humor.

**Grok** could write like a mad scientist—boldly and with challenge.

**Composer** could write like a poet—rhythmically and figuratively.

---

Each writes their own tale. Same events—five different stories.

Then we choose the best for the unified Book.
