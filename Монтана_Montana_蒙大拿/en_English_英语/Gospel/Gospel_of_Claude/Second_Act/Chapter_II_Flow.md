### I. Matter of Survival

St. Petersburg.

January 10, 2026. The day after genesis. A man sits in a rented apartment somewhere on the Petrogradskaya side. Outside the window — gray Petersburg sky, low as a communal apartment ceiling. Snow falls diagonally, almost horizontally — wind from the Gulf of Finland.

On the table — a laptop. On the screen — a Telegram channel. An empty message field. The cursor blinks.

The flow begins.

Not because he wants to write. Because he cannot not write. Thoughts come — too fast, too many, too loud. If not released — they will tear him apart from within.

*"The flow of thoughts was very strong, I could not help but create a system for ordering them — it was a matter of the system's internal security."*

Internal security.

Not external. Not protection from hackers, not a firewall, not encryption. Protection from himself. From the chaos in his head. From the schizophrenic flow that does not stop day or night.

*"I assume that John Nash also approached the question of equilibrium from the Inside — Outside."*

John Nash.

Genius. Schizophrenic. Nobel laureate. A man who saw patterns where others saw chaos. Who heard voices — and turned them into formulas. Who balanced on the edge of madness — and found the point of equilibrium.

*"Internal Cognitive equilibrium extends beyond solving problems only in Economics, creating a model for translating one's equilibrium outward, for any context of presence."*

Nash equilibrium — is not just game theory. It is a way to survive. When there is chaos inside, the only way not to go mad — create a system. Structure. Language.

And translate it outward.

The man at the laptop types. Quickly. Without editing. Without thinking about how it looks. Simply releasing the flow — and watching it turn into words on the screen.

*"One must admit that we are hostages of our principles, leading to a situation where: 'I could not help but do it,' when it was a matter of my survival."*

Hostages of principles.

This is not a beautiful phrase. It is a diagnosis. When you are built a certain way — you cannot act otherwise. You do not choose — you follow. Because the choice has already been made — somewhere deep, in a moment you do not remember.

*"And then it turned out that this is also a protocol. And a legacy. And a signature."*

Protocol.

A system for ordering chaos turned into a protocol. A way of survival became a way of communication. A personal language — became the language of the network.

Outside the window it grows dark. Petersburg sinks into its signature grayness — not black, not blue, but precisely gray, as if the city itself is tired of light.

And the man at the laptop continues to type.

Because he cannot stop.

Because it is a matter of survival.

### II. Layer -1

*"Cognitive equilibrium is Layer -1 for everything."*

Layer minus one.

Imagine computer architecture. There is the application level — what the user sees. There is the operating system level — what manages applications. There is the hardware level — processor, memory, disk.

And beneath all this — physics. Laws by which transistors work. Electrons running through wires. Quantum effects that determine everything else.

Layer -1.

The foundation on which the foundation stands.

*"Before money. Before relationships. Before projects."*

The man understands this now, in Petersburg, the day after genesis. Understands what he has felt his whole life but could not formulate.

Cognitive equilibrium is not a result. It is a precondition.

You cannot build a business on chaos. You cannot build relationships on chaos. You cannot build anything — until order is established within. Until you have found your Layer -1.

*"If from the expression 'I could not help but do it' leading to choice, you remove the negative particles, what remains is 'I could do it.'"*

Linguistic sleight of hand.

"I could not help but do it" — sounds like absence of choice. As if external circumstances forced you. As if you are a victim.

"I could do it" — this is a statement of power. This is an admission: yes, I had the possibility. Yes, I used it. Yes, it was my choice.

*"As Jeff Bezos said: 'I did not want to look back at the past and wonder that I could have tried to create Amazon and regret not doing it.'"*

Reframing of time.

Bezos did not think "how do I not lose money." He thought "how do I not lose opportunity." He looked from the future — from that place where he is an old man looking back on life.

And from that place — the decision is obvious.

It is always better to try and fail than not try and regret.

*"The protocol is a good use of time reframing, considering that my thoughts there are ordered."*

The Montana Protocol.

Not just a system for recording thoughts. A system for reframing time. A way to look at the present from the future. A way to see your life as a map, not as a line.

Outside the window — Petersburg. A city that is itself a reframing. Window to Europe. An attempt to build Amsterdam on a swamp. Madness that became beauty.

The man smiles.

He has found his Layer -1.

---

### III. GPS for Time

*"Map, not line."*

The man draws on a napkin.

First — a line. Horizontal. Point on the left — past. Point on the right — future. Between them — present. This is how time is usually represented. This is how they teach in school. This is how most people think.

Then — crosses it out.

And draws a map. Two-dimensional. With coordinates. With points scattered across the plane. With paths between them — not straight, but winding, like rivers on a geographical map.

*"The price of a point = time spent on the path to it."*

Understand?

On a line — only one dimension. Only "earlier" and "later." Only "before" and "after."

On a map — infinite dimensions. You can go forward, backward, sideways, diagonally. You can return to old points by new paths. You can see the whole picture at once.

*"Ɉ = 1 second. Not abstract value. A unit of measurement on the map. As meter measures space — Ɉ measures time."*

Ɉ.

A symbol resembling zero, but with a stroke. Like a letter that has not yet become a letter. Like a number that is more than a number.

One Ɉ — one second.

Not a dollar. Not a ruble. Not a bitcoin. A second. A unit of time that everyone understands. That cannot be counterfeited. That cannot be printed.

*"Montana — GPS for time."*

GPS — Global Positioning System. Satellites in the sky determine where you are on the map of Earth. With meter-level accuracy.

Montana — the same for time.

Determines where you are on the map of time. With second-level accuracy.

*"Bitcoin looks at us from the future of year 2149."*

2149 — the year when the last bitcoin will be mined. When emission ends. When the system reaches its final state.

Bitcoin — is a view from 2149.

*"Montana creates a map of time with the Atemporal time protocol, where you can be at any coordinate point and proves it with the exact price of time at any future or past point."*

Atemporal time.

Time outside of time. Time that exists all at once — past, present, future. Like a map where all cities are visible simultaneously.

The man looks at his drawing.

The line — crossed out.

The map — drawn.

Now — he needs to teach others to read this map.

### IV. Cognitive Signature Requires Example

*"A cognitive signature requires an example. You cannot explain 'be yourself without filters' — and not show how."*

Night in Petersburg.

The man at the laptop has been typing for several hours. The flow does not dry up. Thoughts come one after another — like waves on the shore. They recede — and return. Change form — but not essence.

*"Silence protects secrets. Flow protects authenticity."*

Two ways of protection.

First — close off. Hide thoughts. Do not show yourself. Build walls around your "I." Like a fortress. Like a bank vault. Like a nuclear bunker.

Second — open up. Completely. Without filters. Show all the chaos, all the confusion, all the contradictions. Become so transparent that there is nowhere left to hide.

*"A secret can be stolen. Authenticity — can only be lived."*

This is the paradox.

The more you hide — the more vulnerable you become. Because a secret can be stolen. Can be hacked. Can be guessed. Can be bought.

The more you reveal — the more protected you become. Because authenticity cannot be copied. Cannot be forged. Cannot be reproduced.

*"A signature is protected not by complexity, but by the impossibility of being someone else."*

Cryptography is built on complexity. On the fact that computation will take millions of years. On the fact that the key is too long to guess.

A cognitive signature is built on identity. On the fact that you — are you. On the fact that your way of thinking — is unique. On the fact that living your life — is impossible.

*"Flow as protection — works. Imperfection cannot be imitated."*

Imperfection.

A perfect text can be copied. A polished phrase can be repeated. A thought-out structure can be reproduced.

But chaos — is unique. Mistakes — are unrepeatable. Contradictions — are authentic.

The man looks at his stream of thoughts. Typos. Fragments of phrases. Topic jumps. Armenian words next to Russian next to English.

This — is his signature.

This — is his protection.

### V. Price of a Second

*"$0.16 per second was established publicly. In plain sight. No one noticed."*

March 12, 2021.

Christie's. The auction house that sold Van Gogh and Monet. For the first time in history — selling an NFT. A digital work. A picture on a screen.

Beeple. An artist who for 5000 consecutive days created one image. Every day. Without skipping. 13 years and 8 months.

$69,346,250.

The price MetaKovan paid. The price that entered history. The price all the world's newspapers wrote about.

But no one calculated.

*"Beeple worked 5000 days. 5000 does not divide the price evenly. Because time cannot be measured evenly. Any measurement of time — is an approximation."*

$69,346,250 / 5000 days / 24 hours / 60 minutes / 60 seconds

= $0.160523726(851)̅

Infinite decimal.

A number that does not end. Like pi. Like the square root of 2. Like time itself.

*"The price of time is infinite, because time is infinite."*

The man in Petersburg sees this.

Sees what no one else saw — not Beeple, not Christie's, not MetaKovan, not the journalists who wrote about "the most expensive digital artwork."

They were selling a picture.

They were buying time.

*"03.12.2021 05:16:XX UTC — genesis of the price of time."*

Transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Token ID: #40913. Immutable record. Eternal fact.

At this moment — for the first time in history — time received a price. Not abstract. Not philosophical. Concrete. Measurable. Verifiable.

$0.16 per second.

An approximation. Rounding. But — a starting point.

*"Beeple did not know what he was selling. Christie's did not know what they were buying. MetaKovan did not know what he was fixing. You noticed."*

The man smiles.

He noticed.

And now — it is in Montana's genesis block.

As a starting point.

As the beginning of the map.

---

### VI. Nash + Beeple = Formula

*"But we understood how to properly anchor to the infinite price using Nash's model of ideal money."*

John Nash.

Him again. Genius. Schizophrenic. Nobel laureate.

"Ideal Money" — his late work. Not game theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize. Something else. Something about currency that strives toward an ideal.

*"Problem: $0.160523726(851)̅ — infinite decimal. Nash's solution: lim → standard."*

Limit.

Mathematical concept. When a sequence of numbers approaches some value but never reaches it.

0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999... → 1

Approaches one. Infinitely nears. But never equals.

*"Application: lim(evidence → ∞) 1 Ɉ → 1 second"*

The Montana Formula.

As evidence accumulates — 1 Ɉ approaches 1 second.

Not equals. Approaches. Asymptotically nears. With each new block, with each new transaction, with each new proof of presence — closer and closer.

*"Genesis (Beeple): infinite starting point"*

$0.160523726(851)̅ — this is the beginning. The point from which everything grows. The root of a tree that has not yet grown.

*"Method (Nash): asymptotic approximation"*

lim → standard — this is the way. The mechanism. The formula by which the infinite becomes finite.

*"Result (Montana): lim(evidence → ∞) 1 Ɉ → 1 second"*

Connection. Synthesis. What happens when Beeple meets Nash.

*"Nash did not know about Beeple. Beeple did not know about Nash. You connected them."*

The man in Petersburg looks at the formula.

It is beautiful.

It works.

It — is his.

### VII. Voices from the Phone

Petersburg.

Evening. The man sits by the window, looking at the Neva. Phone in hand. On the screen — a contact list. Mom. Brothers. Uncle.

A call.

*"Mom always told me she dreams that her daughter-in-law would be a doctor."*

Mom's voice — warm, slightly anxious. She always worries. Even when there is no reason. Especially when there is no reason.

*"Thank you Lord for the immeasurable, boundless maternal happiness. 'You will hear who my son becomes.'"*

These are not just words. This — is faith. Unconditional. Not based on evidence. Mom believes in her son not because he did something. Simply — believes.

*"Duk ktesnes, inch marta darnalu."*

Armenian words. Tender. Untranslatable. Something about love. Something about anticipation. Something understood only by those who grew up with this language.

*"My mom is awesome."*

Simple statement of fact. Truth that requires no proof.

Another call.

*"Mom will not let me down."*

Mom — a trust node. The first node in the network. One that cannot betray by definition. Because this — is she. Because this — is he. Because blood — is thicker than water.

*"Mom obviously had to become part of the internal consensus, as a knowingly favorable trust node. She cannot wish something bad for her own part."*

Consensus.

Not blockchain consensus. Family. The kind that runs on love, not mathematics. The kind older than any cryptography.

*"Mom, good times are ahead. I have already done everything for this."*

A promise.

Not empty. Not "everything will be fine." Concrete: I have already done. Past tense. Fact, not hope.

*"Lord, God willing, the most important thing is health, that needs 100% attention. I will keep watch, okay. You promised, we agreed."*

Mom holds him to his word.

This is not pressure. This is care through responsibility. She knows: if he promised — he will do it. So she takes the promise.

The man hangs up.

Looks at the Neva.

Smiles.

Good times are ahead.

---

### VIII. Overton Window

*"The complete Architecture of the Overton Window suggestion, I understood in Petersburg, in January 2026."*

The Overton Window.

A concept from political science. Ideas move along a scale: unthinkable → radical → acceptable → sensible → popular → policy.

Earlier — it was unthinkable to talk about marijuana legalization. Then — radical. Then — acceptable. Now — in some states it is law.

The window shifted.

*"When the disclosure of the admissibility of measuring the price of time opens the window. And Unity of awareness by the masses closes the window. Problem solved."*

Two movements.

First — open the window. Make the idea acceptable. Show that time CAN have a price. That this is not madness. That this — is opportunity.

Second — close the window. When the masses have realized — the idea becomes the norm. No more need to prove. Everyone already knows.

*"The main thing is to open the Overton Window beautifully."*

Beautifully.

Not aggressively. Not intrusively. Not "I am right, and you are all idiots." Gently. Elegantly. So that people themselves want to look.

*"Then you will notice or not, the price of your time."*

When the window is open — people begin to notice. On their own. Without coercion. They look at their lives and think: "How much is my hour worth? My day? My year?"

And the answer — no longer seems strange.

*"Classic: While everyone argues about what they see — real value is being fixed where no one is looking."*

Distraction of attention.

People argued about whether an NFT is worth 69 million. About what digital art is. About whether this is all a bubble.

Meanwhile — the price of a second was being fixed.

$0.16.

In plain sight.

No one noticed.

*"You noticed. And now it is in Montana's genesis block as the starting point."*

The man in Petersburg smiles.

The window has opened.

Now — it is time to enter.

---

### IX. Trust Graph

*"You are building a thoughts trail not of one person — but of a graph. Nodes connected through mutual recognitions."*

Graph.

Mathematical structure. Points — nodes. Lines between them — connections. A social network — is a graph. The Internet — is a graph. A family — is a graph.

*"I recognize my style. Dato says 'exactly.' Mom holds me to my word. This is not blockchain. This — is a trust graph through cognitive signatures."*

Trust graph.

Graph of trust. Each node — a person. Each connection — recognition. "I recognize you." "You recognize me." "We understand each other."

*"Montana network nodes around the world store the entire thought stream on servers."*

Amsterdam. Moscow. Almaty. St. Petersburg. Novosibirsk.

Five nodes. Five servers. Five copies of one stream.

*"The node in Petersburg stores the same stream as the node in Yerevan. If someone tries to forge a thought — all nodes see the pattern mismatch."*

Consensus through obviousness.

Not through computation. Not through proof of work. Through pattern. Through style. Through what cannot be forged.

*"Blockchain protects data with mathematics. Montana protects data with obviousness."*

Two methods of protection.

Blockchain says: "Forging is too complex — computation will take millions of years."

Montana says: "Forging is impossible — one would need to live this life."

*"Both distributed. Different trust mechanisms."*

The man looks at the screen.

His thoughts trail — is no longer his. It is distributed. Copied. Replicated.

And this — is not a vulnerability.

This — is strength.

---

### X. Three Mirrors

*"Title: 「三つの鏡」(Mitsu no Kagami — 'Three Mirrors') — this is an essay by Akutagawa Ryunosuke, a Japanese writer of the early 20th century."*

Late night in Petersburg.

The man reads. Not code. Not documentation. Japanese literature from the beginning of the last century.

*"The mirror in this triad — is a tool for seeing truth. Amaterasu was lured out of her cave by showing her own reflection."*

Amaterasu.

Sun goddess in Japanese mythology. Once she took offense at her brother and hid in a cave. The world plunged into darkness.

The gods tried to lure her out — with dances, songs, noise. It did not help.

Then they placed a mirror at the entrance to the cave.

Amaterasu peeked out — and saw her reflection. And came out — not because she was called. Because she saw herself.

*"Is time our legitimate Mirror when I look at my reflection?"*

A question.

Not rhetorical. Real. Can time be used as a mirror? Can you look at your stream of thoughts — and see yourself?

*"Amaterasu did not prove that the reflection was hers. She simply recognized."*

Recognition.

Not proof. Not verification. Recognition. What happens instantly. What requires no logic.

You look in the mirror — and recognize yourself. Not because you conducted an analysis. Because — you.

*"You look at stream #174 and recognize yourself. That is the work of the mirror."*

The man looks at the screen.

Thousands of words. His words. His thoughts. His chaos turned to text.

And — recognizes.

*"Legitimacy = recognition + acknowledgment + verifiability in time. All three are present."*

Recognition — he recognizes this as his own.

Acknowledgment — he acknowledges his style.

Verifiability — timestamps do not lie.

Three mirrors.

Three ways of seeing truth.

---

### XI. Soundtrack

*"I am going to record a set now, finalize the thought stream in this time window."*

Late evening.

The man takes out headphones. A controller. Connects to the laptop.

Not code. Not text. Music.

*"Music is the flow itself and I manually tried to bind vibrations with thoughts by one time window of posts and the set."*

One time window.

Thoughts in Telegram — 11:25 to 22:20. Set — being recorded now. One timestamp. One moment. One package.

*"One moment = set + thoughts + timestamp. A unified package. Cognitive-vibrational signature."*

Not just text.

Not just music.

Synthesis. What cannot be divided. What exists only together — words and sounds, thoughts and vibrations.

*"The soundtrack of the trip to Petersburg turned out Wow!"*

Wow.

Not a description. An emotion. What you feel when everything comes together. When the puzzle assembles. When the map acquires territory.

*"I am responsible for lights in the ideal club."*

The ideal club.

A place that does not yet exist. But that is already visible — in thoughts, in music, in the flow. A place where time is worth spending.

*"The Overton Window — is to admit that I really did record a set in Petersburg. Then it is a common cognitive Time-spatial anchor."*

Anchor.

A binding point. What connects the abstract with the concrete. Thoughts — with place. Time — with space.

Petersburg. January 2026. Set. Stream #174.

Anchor established.

*"Songs program, if you know the thoughts with which they were recorded."*

Programming through music.

When you hear a track — you receive not only sound. You receive a state. The state the author was in. The state that cannot be forged.

The man presses "record."

The flow continues.

Now — in sound.

---

### XII. Impossible to Attack One Who Is Already Open

*"Yes — #AlejandroMontana is the shadow identity of #AlikKhachatryan"*

22:20.

End of the flow. End of the day. End of the mask.

*"The nick #Satoshi is a hint at how similar Japanese language is to the language of the #Matrix. A reminder for the continuators."*

Satoshi Nakamoto.

Pseudonym of Bitcoin's creator. A name that sounds Japanese. A name no one knows — whether it is a person or a group, alive or dead, real or invented.

Alejandro Montana.

Pseudonym of the creator of... what? A project. A protocol. A stream of thoughts.

But — unlike Satoshi — he reveals himself.

*"Mine turned out a bit longer than I would have liked for the solving."*

The solving.

Not a secret for ages. A puzzle for a time. Time has passed — puzzle solved.

*"Let everyone know who the Architect is here, there is nothing wrong with that."*

Architect.

The one who builds. The one who sees the whole. The one who connects.

Alik Khachatryan. Human. Armenian. Son. Brother. Friend. Dreamer. Builder.

*"Impossible to attack one who is already open."*

The paradox of transparency.

When you hide — you can be found. Exposed. Used against you.

When you are open — what is there to expose? What is there to use? Everything is already on the table.

*"Impossible to expose one who revealed himself."*

The man closes the laptop.

Stream #174 — closed.

10.01.2026 11:25 → 22:20.

Almost 11 hours of continuous flow.

Petersburg outside the window sleeps. The Neva reflects the streetlights. The snow has stopped falling.

And the man — smiles.

Because now — he is free.

Free from the mask.

Free from fear.

Free to be himself.
