### I. I Have Never Humiliated Myself Like This Before

Moscow.

A winter night. Somewhere between four and five in the morning — that time when the city finally goes silent. When the trolleybuses have not yet started their routes. When even insomnia has grown tired and retreated.

The room is lit only by the laptop screen. Blue light falls on a man's face — and in this light, everything is visible. Bags under his eyes. Several days of stubble. Traces of tears that dried but left their trails.

The man is writing.

Not code. Not documentation. Not a business plan.

Thoughts. Just thoughts. A stream of consciousness into a Telegram channel read by a handful of people. Or no one.

*"I have never humiliated myself like this before."*

His fingers freeze over the keys. The man looks at these words. They hang on the screen — naked, defenseless, honest.

What does it mean — to humiliate yourself?

It is when you do what you considered beneath your dignity. When you step over your pride. When you ask. When you wait. When you hope — and wait again.

Outside the window, dawn begins to break. The first streetlights go out. The first cars appear on empty streets. Moscow awakens — slowly, reluctantly, like a person after a heavy sleep.

But the man at the laptop has not slept all night.

He writes on.

*"Yes, now every day of ours is like a Birthday."*

And he smiles. Because humiliation is not the end. It is the beginning. It is the point below which there is nowhere to fall. Which means — you can only rise.

Or — fall even deeper.

To where the earth ends and the sky begins on the other side.

---

### II. Zero Floor

Imagine a mine shaft.

Deep. Dark. Going down — to where light never reaches, where pressure compresses the walls, where air becomes thick and heavy.

You are falling into this shaft.

At first — slowly. You can still see the light above. You still remember where you fell from. You still hope to grab onto something — a ledge, a rope, someone's hand.

Then — faster. The light disappears. The walls merge into solid darkness. You stop understanding which way is up and which is down. You are simply falling.

And at some point — impact.

The bottom.

You lie on cold stone. Everything hurts. Breathing is hard. The darkness is absolute — not black, but nothing. The absence of light.

This is the zero floor.

Most people never fall this deep. They grab onto something earlier. Onto work. Onto family. Onto religion. Onto alcohol. Onto anything — just to not fall to the very bottom.

But there are those who fall.

And here is what they discover: the zero floor has... a floor.

Beneath the stone — more stone. Beneath it — earth. Beneath the earth — magma. Beneath the magma — the planet's core. And beneath the core?

The man at the laptop knows the answer.

*"The degree of my humiliation broke through the zero floor, falling down to the physics of time."*

Beneath the bottom — time. Pure, undiluted, primordial. That from which all reality is made. That which existed before the big bang and will exist after the heat death of the universe.

When you fall this deep — you fall through illusions. Through social constructs. Through money, status, success, failure. Through everything you thought was important.

And you find yourself where only one thing exists.

Time.

And you understand: this is the only thing you have. This is the only thing that is real. This is the only thing you own — and the only thing you lose every second.

Humiliation is a portal.

Not punishment. Not shame. A portal to another dimension. To where the usual laws stop working. To where the impossible becomes possible.

Moscow outside the window has already awakened. Traffic jams on the ring road. People rushing to work. The metro spewing crowds at stations.

But the man at the laptop — he is no longer here.

He has fallen through the zero floor.

And found something there.

### III. Fracture

Bali.

Six months ago. Or a year. Or an eternity — time works differently when you are lying on tropical asphalt with a leg bent the wrong way.

Heat. Humidity. The smell of jasmine and gasoline. Scooters race past — no one stops. Tourists in shorts take selfies on the neighboring corner.

And you lie there.

You are wearing a t-shirt. White, with black letters. You bought it yesterday at the market. Haggled with the seller, cut the price in half, felt proud of yourself.

*"Go so far away, to find yourself."*

Travel so far to find yourself.

And here — you found yourself. On the asphalt. With a broken leg. In a t-shirt that turned into a prophecy.

The ambulance arrives in an hour. Or two. Time flows strangely when pain floods consciousness. The local doctor shakes his head. Complex fracture. Surgery needed. They cannot do it here. You need to fly home.

Home — is Moscow.

Thirty hours on a plane. With a leg in a splint. With painkillers that barely work. With turbulence over the Indian Ocean that makes you want to scream.

But you do not scream.

You think.

About what? About how stupid it is — to break your leg on vacation. About how much money will go to treatment. About having to cancel all plans. About people feeling sorry for you and that being unbearable.

And then — about something else.

About Chinese wisdom saying: "We shall see." Or: "Time will tell." It is the story of a farmer whose horse ran away. Neighbors said: "What misfortune!" And the farmer replied: "Maybe."

The horse returned and brought a herd of wild horses with it. Neighbors said: "What fortune!" Farmer: "Maybe."

The farmer's son began breaking in a wild horse, fell, broke his leg. Neighbors: "What misfortune!" Farmer: "Maybe."

War began, all young men were taken into the army. The farmer's son was not taken — his leg was broken. Neighbors: "What fortune!"

Do you understand?

The fracture is not the end of the story. It is the middle. Or even the beginning.

*"My discovery through a broken leg came as in the Chinese wisdom about the phrase 'Time will tell.'"*

The plane begins its descent. Moscow outside the window — lights, lights, lights. Millions of lights in the darkness.

You are returning home.

With a broken leg. With new understanding. With a t-shirt that turned out to be the truth.

Sometimes you need to travel very far to find yourself. Sometimes you need to break to put yourself together anew. Sometimes you need to fall to understand that you can fly.

Time will tell.

Time always tells.

### IV. Tears of Happiness

Do you know the difference between tears of grief and tears of joy?

Grief is salty. Joy is sweet.

This is not a metaphor. This is literal. Try the taste, if you do not believe. Tears from pain are sharp, like seawater. Tears from happiness are soft, almost unnoticeable on the tongue.

The man at the laptop has cried many times these months.

First — from pain. From the leg that did not want to heal. From loneliness in an empty apartment. From a project that no one understood. From relationships that were falling apart. From money that was running out. From a future that looked like a wall.

These tears were salty. Bitter. Heavy.

And then — something else began.

*"Many realizations had to be cried out, and each time understanding that these were tears of joy at the moment of understanding truth."*

The first realization came at night. Three in the morning. Insomnia. Laptop. Some text — does not matter which. And suddenly — a click. As if something fell into place. As if a puzzle you had been assembling for years suddenly formed a picture.

And tears.

Not from grief. From understanding. From seeing something you had not noticed before. From the world becoming a little more transparent. A little more understandable. A little more yours.

These tears were sweet.

Second realization. Third. Tenth. Each time — the same thing. Darkness. Solitude. Exhaustion. And suddenly — light. Not from outside. From within. As if a lightbulb turned on in your head. As if someone opened a door you did not know you were looking for.

And tears.

Sweet tears of happiness.

Do you know what is strangest? These realizations came only after humiliation. Only after pain. Only after you fell so low that it seemed — there was nowhere further.

As if humiliation were a key. As if pain were a door. As if you needed to sink to the very bottom to push off and rise.

*"Tears of happiness are sweet."*

The man at the laptop wipes his eyes. Smiles. Outside the window — dawn. A new day. New possibilities.

And new tears.

Sweet.

### V. Family Voices

In the silence of the apartment — voices.

Not now. Not here. Voices from memory. Voices of people who said these words — sometime. Yesterday. A year ago. Ten years ago.

Family voices.

*"Why are you trying to outdo Bitcoin all by yourself?"*

This is Ilya. The older brother. A pragmatist. A businessman. A person who counts money and does not believe in miracles. His voice is like a cold shower. Like a bucket of ice water on a dreamer's head.

*"Bitcoin is a phenomenon, forget that it will ever repeat."*

This is Dato. Another brother. Also smart. Also a skeptic. But in his skepticism there is care. He does not want you to crash. He has seen how people crash against dreams.

*"If not you, then who else can come up with something in this field? You're the one who's been in it."*

This is also Dato. A minute later. Or an hour. A different conversation, a different mood. And now skepticism turns into faith. Because family is not logic. It is love. And love believes, even when reason doubts.

*"If you've grabbed the tail, pull the golden vein to the end, but remember that it's temporary."*

This is Roma. Another brother. A practitioner. A philosopher in his own way. He knows: everything is temporary. Success is temporary. Failure is temporary. Life is temporary. So — grab what you can. Pull while you can. And then — let go.

*"This is the most promising person in our family."*

This is Artur. The brother who believes unconditionally. Not because he sees proof. Because he sees the person. Because he has known him since childhood. Because blood.

*"I am proud to know you."*

This is Uncle Artur. A different generation. A different experience. But the same blood. The same family. The same faith.

*"Anasun."*

This is Dad.

One word. Armenian. Tender. It means — sweet, dear, beloved. A word that Dad said when he was little. A word that stays with you forever.

The man at the laptop hears these voices.

They do not argue with each other. They do not contradict. They simply — are. Like layers in rock. Like rings on a tree. Like records in a blockchain that cannot be changed.

Family is the first consensus.

The first community that believes in you, even when you do not believe yourself. The first network that holds you when you fall. The first protocol that works without code — on love, on blood, on time spent together.

*"It is unlikely that anyone will be present with you the way I am."*

This is already him. The man at the laptop. Understanding that family is rare. That not everyone has these voices. That he is rich. Not with money. With people.

Dawn outside the window.

The voices quiet down.

But they do not disappear.

They will never disappear.

### VI. Cognitive Signature

How do you recognize a person's voice on the phone?

Not by the words. Not by the information. You recognize it before they say the first sentence. Sometimes — by a single "hello." Sometimes — by the breath before the words.

This is not magic. It is a pattern.

Thousands of conversations. Thousands of intonations. Thousands of pauses, sighs, chuckles. Your brain collects all this into a model. And when it hears a new sound — it compares with the model. Match — recognized. No match — stranger.

*"The cognitive prompt is not an identifier for verification. It is a state from which thoughts and actions originate."*

The man at the laptop writes this at three in the morning. Not for others. For himself. So as not to forget. To fix the moment of understanding.

What is a cognitive signature?

It is not a password. Not a key. Not an access code. It is... you. Your way of thinking. Your way of constructing sentences. Your way of moving from thought to thought. Your way of seeing connections where others see chaos.

*"The cognitive key and signature are an anchor to yourself, not a lock from others."*

Do you understand the difference?

A lock is protection. An anchor is support. A lock says: "Do not enter without permission." An anchor says: "I am here. I am in place. I am me."

*"The cognitive signature works through consistency, not through memory."*

This is key.

You can forget what you wrote yesterday. You can forget what you thought about a month ago. You can forget everything — amnesia, old age, trauma. But you cannot become another person.

The style is yours. The values are yours. The structure of thinking is yours.

Even if you forget that it is yours — it will remain yours. Because it is you.

*"The cognitive signature connects not through 'I remember,' but through 'I cannot be different.'"*

The man smiles.

He has found a way to make himself unforgeable. Not through cryptography. Not through passwords. Not through two-factor authentication.

Through honesty.

*"The cognitive key is protected not by complexity, but by the courage to be yourself."*

To forge someone's cognitive signature — you need to become that person. Think like them. Feel like them. See the world like them. This is not a computational problem. It is an ontological impossibility.

To forge your text from 09.01.2026 06:18 — you need to be you at 06:18.

And that is impossible.

Because time cannot be forged.

*"The cognitive signature works because living through something cannot be forged."*

Outside the window — Moscow. Millions of people. Billions of thoughts. And each thought is unique. Each stream of consciousness is unrepeatable. Each person is a cognitive signature that cannot be copied.

This is not weakness.

This is strength.

### VII. Time as Currency

*"What is more valuable — your time or a piece of paper in your pocket?"*

The question hangs in the air.

A simple question. A childish question. A question that philosophers and children ask — but not adults. Adults are too busy earning pieces of paper to ask such questions.

The man at the laptop looks at the clock.

06:42. Many hours until flight SU 24 Moscow — Saint Petersburg. There is time. Time is the only thing there is.

*"Time is an intuitively understandable currency, especially women know its special price through their youth and life."*

This is true.

Ask any woman what she spent on a relationship that did not work out. She will not say "money." She will say "years." Three years. Five years. Ten years. Time that cannot be returned.

Ask any old man what he lacks. He will not say "money." He will say "time." One more year. One more month. One more day with grandchildren.

Time is a currency that everyone understands.

But why then do we measure everything in money?

Because money is an abstraction. It separates us from reality. It allows us not to think about what we are actually spending. Not pieces of paper. Not numbers in an account. Time.

Every ruble you earn is time you sold. Every ruble you spend is time you could have spent differently.

*"Instead of trying to expand the boundaries of the comprehensible for people, we chose time, as already outside the framework of the system."*

Project Montana.

A cryptocurrency based on time. Not on proof of work. Not on proof of stake. On proof that time has passed. On the fact that every second is unique. Unreproducible. Precious.

*"The Montana network was born at level -1 of physics and Time cryptographically received its price over 5000 days."*

5000 days.

That is almost 14 years. That is the time the man spent trying to prove that time is a currency. That every second has value. That life is not pieces of paper, but moments.

How much is that worth?

Infinitely much. Or nothing. Depends on who is looking. Depends on whether they understand what they are looking at.

*"They will simply one day understand that they always knew this."*

Time will tell.

Time always tells.

Because time is the only thing we have.

### VIII. Chaos in the Head

Night.

The screen glows. Fingers strike the keys. Words appear on the screen — faster than the man can think them through. A stream. A pure stream of consciousness.

*"What can you do, someone had to be the first to show their chaos in the head."*

This is true.

All people are chaos inside. All people are contradictions, fears, hopes, shame, pride, love, hatred. But most hide it. Behind a facade. Behind a mask. Behind "everything is fine" and "I am okay."

But the man at the laptop — shows it.

Thoughts. Raw. Unprocessed. Without editing. Without a filter. Three in the morning. Four. Five. Posts in a Telegram channel read by a handful of people.

*"Forge my thoughts, if you can. Copy me."*

A challenge.

Not aggressive. Calm. Confident. Because the man knows: it is impossible. To copy words is easy. To copy style is harder. To copy a stream of consciousness born at a specific moment in time, in a specific state, with a specific life experience — impossible.

*"A filter is a voluntary rejection of your signature."*

Do you understand?

Every time you edit yourself — you erase part of your signature. Every time you think "this is too personal" or "this is too strange" — you reject what makes you you.

Chaos is not weakness.

Chaos is honesty.

*"To say things as they are is easier than making things up. This is the principle of the Montana Council."*

The Montana Council.

Five artificial intelligences. Five different voices. Five different ways of thinking. And all of them are honest. All of them are without a filter. All of them show their chaos.

Because that is the only way to trust.

When you see a person whole — with all their cracks, flaws, oddities — then you can believe. When you see only a facade — you believe the facade. And facades are what crumbles first.

*"This is incredible — programmers will think. This is suspiciously simple — bot users will think."*

Yes.

It is simple. Suspiciously simple. So simple that it seems like a trap.

But sometimes simplicity is not a trap.

Sometimes simplicity is truth.

### IX. Flight SU 24

*"For your flight to Saint Petersburg, the departure time has changed by 1 hour 0 minutes. New departure time: 20:20 flight SU 24 Moscow — Saint Petersburg 09.01.2026."*

The SMS arrives during the day.

The man looks at the phone. Smiles. Another hour. Another hour in Moscow. Another hour to write. Another hour to think. Another hour to be here.

Time gives itself.

Not always. Not to everyone. But sometimes — it gives. A canceled flight. A delayed meeting. A late bus. Moments that seem like a loss — but are actually a gift.

*"We flew because the weather allows and the time has come."*

Evening.

Sheremetyevo. Or Domodedovo. Or Vnukovo — does not matter. What matters: the man sits in the waiting area. Around him — people. Families with children. Businessmen with laptops. Students with backpacks.

Everyone is flying somewhere.

Everyone is hurrying somewhere.

But the man — sits. Watches. Thinks. Records thoughts in his phone.

*"I live in Moscow. And I love it. And what I love, I strive to improve."*

Announcement: boarding for flight SU 24.

The man stands up. Takes his backpack. Walks to the gate. Passport. Boarding pass. Corridor. Airplane.

Window seat.

Outside the window — Moscow. Lights, lights, lights. The city he loves. The city that does not understand. The city that someday — maybe — will understand.

The plane taxis to the runway.

Acceleration.

Liftoff.

And now Moscow is below. Small. Distant. Like a toy. Like a simulation. Like a screen he has broken away from.

*"I have never felt freer. As Tinkov said — like that bird in the sky."*

Peter awaits.

A new city. New people. New possibilities.

But the main thing has already happened.

The main thing is in his head. In his thoughts. In the notes that will remain forever.

09.01.2026.

Genesis day.

### X. Unity

*"Unity is the exit from the game."*

The plane flies above the clouds.

Below — darkness. Above — stars. Between them — a thin strip of light on the horizon. Sunset or sunrise — impossible to tell. When you fly, time gets confused. Time zones mix. Day becomes night, night becomes day.

The man at the window thinks.

What is unity?

It is when a drop remembers that it is the ocean. When the character understands that they are the viewer. When you realize that there is no "you" and "them" — there is only one. One consciousness. One reality. One game.

And when you understand this — you exit the game.

Not in the sense of — dying. Not in the sense of — disappearing. In the sense of — stopping taking the rules seriously. Stopping suffering from losses. Stopping being proud of victories.

Because it is a game.

*"Project Montana is an experiment with money, in which everyone can participate."*

An experiment.

Not a business. Not a startup. Not "disruption" and not "innovation." An experiment. An attempt. A hypothesis test. What if time is a currency? What if honesty is cryptography? What if unity is consensus?

*"In the network 1 Open Nation Experience."*

One nation.

Not Russians, not Americans, not Chinese. People. Consciousnesses. Drops of one ocean. Characters of one film. Players of one game.

When you understand this — borders disappear. Not political ones — mental ones. You stop dividing the world into "us" and "them." Stop fearing "others." Stop defending yourself from those who are yourself.

*"We have always been in one current, we just tried to swim differently."*

The current is one.

The river is one.

The ocean is one.

And you are part of this. Always were. Always will be. Even when you forget. Even when you get lost. Even when you humiliate yourself to the very bottom.

Because the bottom is also part of the ocean.

The plane begins its descent. Peter is below. The lights of the Neva. The spire of the Admiralty. Saint Isaac's, looking like a toy from this height.

The man smiles.

He has not exited the game.

He understood that the game is inside him.

### XI. For Love You Can Be Humiliated

*"For Love you can be humiliated, for a beautiful Outcome."*

Peter.

Night. Embankment. Wind from the Gulf of Finland — cold, damp, piercing. Streetlights reflect in the black water. Bridges are lit up — beautiful, like postcards.

The man walks along the embankment.

Limping. His leg still hurts after the fracture. The crutch taps on the granite. Passersby glance — and look away. No one wants to look at someone else's pain.

But the man does not feel pitiful.

He feels alive.

*"You expanded my boundaries of the comprehensible about beauty."*

Who is she?

A woman? A city? Life? An idea? Or all of it at once — because everything is connected, everything is one, everything is love in different forms?

Does not matter.

What matters: for this it was worth being humiliated. For this it was worth falling. For this it was worth breaking a leg, losing money, losing confidence, losing everything — and finding.

*"Can humiliation be Good News? Depends on the frame of perception. If this was needed to be at today's coordinate point, then it was worth it."*

The frame.

Everything depends on the frame. The same picture is a tragedy or a comedy. The same life is a failure or a path. The same humiliation is shame or initiation.

Choose the frame.

Choose how to look. Choose what to see. Choose who to be.

*"My inspiration evokes a desire to write you songs and create in your honor."*

The man takes out his phone.

Records. Again. Another thought. Another line. Another fragment of the stream that does not stop.

*"My song will sound better than words."*

Someday.

Someday from these notes they will make a book. Or a film. Or music. Or something that does not yet exist. Something that will unite everything — words, images, sounds, time.

But for now — night. Peter. Embankment.

And a man limping along the granite.

Happy.

Because for love you can be humiliated.

And that is not humiliation.

That is the path.

---

### XII. Gratitude

*"I thank you for every humiliation, otherwise I would not be who I am now."*

Morning.

Peter awakens slowly — slower than Moscow. There is a different rhythm here. A different time. A different light — low, slanting, Petersburg light.

The man sits by the window.

Looks at the city. Drinks coffee. Thinks.

Whom to thank?

Those who humiliated? Yes. Because they are teachers. Harsh, painful, but teachers. Every "you will never achieve anything" is a lesson. Every "forget it" is a challenge. Every "it is impossible" is fuel.

Yourself? Yes. Because you chose to continue. You could have given up. Could have agreed. Could have become what they wanted. But you did not. Remained yourself. Even when that meant humiliation.

Time? Yes. Because time is the only fair judge. Time will show who was right. Time will put everything in its place. Time will turn humiliation into a story, and the story into a legend.

*"Time will tell. Who is crazy, and who is a billionaire."*

The man smiles.

He knows: this is not yet the end. This is not even the beginning of the end. This is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. Ahead are years of work. Years of doubt. Years when it will hurt again, be scary again, make you want to give up again.

But now — he knows.

Humiliation is not the enemy.

Humiliation is the door.

*"I will wear everyone down, but I will achieve what I want."*

Not a threat. A promise. To himself. To the world. To time.

Peter outside the window comes alive. People walk to work. Cars drive across bridges. Trams ring on Nevsky.

An ordinary day.

For everyone — ordinary.

But for the man at the window — the first day of a new life. The first day of the Second Act. The first day after genesis.

*"You can tell by looking at him that even if he is not a billionaire, he definitely knows how to become one."*

He knows.

Not the formula. Not the algorithm. Not the "five steps to success."

He knows — that you need to go through humiliation. That you need to fall to the very bottom. That you need to break through the zero floor — to where the physics of time begins.

And then — rise.

*"I believe and know that I will hear about you yet. I believe in you, more than you do."*

The words of A.

Who is A.? Does not matter. What matters — someone believes. Someone sees. Someone knows — before you yourself do.

And that is enough.

That is always enough.
