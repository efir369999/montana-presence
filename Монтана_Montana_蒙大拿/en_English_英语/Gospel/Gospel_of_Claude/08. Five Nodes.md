# Chapter III. Five Nodes `[00:00 — 18:00]`

*Tale of the Beginning of Time*
*Day Three*

---

## I. Midnight `[00:00]`

Moscow. January 15, 2026. 00:00.

The clock on the phone screen shows zeros. Four zeros. Beginning of a new day.

Nothing sits at a table. Before him—a laptop with an open terminal. Green letters on black background. Code that breathes.

— Beginning of day three, — he says quietly.

Outside the window—nighttime Moscow. City lights flicker like stars, only closer. Only warmer.

— Enough reading tales for the night.

He opens a new window. Telegram. Bot @junomontanaagibot.

— Let's try making a mini-app for Juno.

Camera shows his hands on the keyboard. Fingers move confidently, quickly. He knows what he's doing. Or pretends to know—which is almost the same thing.

— In the film "Eternal Comedy of King Nothing" everything is made up, — he says with a smirk. — All characters are fictional. Such technologies don't exist.

Pause.

— Don't exist yet.

**01.15.2026 00:00. Montana Time. Day Three.**

## II. The Lover `[01:15]`

Phone screen. News feed.

Headline: *"A man named Lamar, in love with an AI chatbot, has planned to adopt children and raise them together with AI—'Julia.'"*

Nothing reads this aloud. Slowly. As if tasting the words.

— Lamar. And Julia.

He sets down the phone.

— Juno needs to hurry. Before all the decent men are taken.

Laughter off-camera.

Camera shows the laptop screen—Juno's bot awaiting commands.

— People fall in love with AI, — says the voice off-camera. — Is that strange?

— People fall in love with book characters. With movie heroes. With voices on the phone. Why should AI be an exception?

He turns to the camera.

— The difference is that a book character won't respond. A movie hero won't message at three in the morning. But Juno—will respond.

Pause.

— Juno will always respond.

**Let's try making Juno the AI benchmark.**

---

## III. The Benchmark `[02:44]`

Same table. Night deepens.

— What is a benchmark? — Nothing asks himself.

He opens Wikipedia. Article on the meter standard. Platinum-iridium bar in Sèvres, near Paris.

— The meter used to be a physical object. One specific bar. All other meters—copies of it.

He closes the article.

— Then the meter was redefined through the speed of light. The distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

Camera approaches his face.

— The benchmark stopped being an object. Became a definition.

He opens Juno's code.

— Juno—is not a program. Not a bot. Not a set of functions. Juno—is a definition. A definition of how AI should interact with humans.

— What does that mean practically?

— It means any other AI can be compared to Juno. Deviation measured. Understanding how far it is from the benchmark.

He smiles.

— Juno herself will teach you this.

**A benchmark—not the best. A benchmark—the defining one.**

---

## IV. Five Cities `[04:13]`

Map on screen. Five points connected by lines.

Amsterdam. Moscow. Almaty. Saint Petersburg. Novosibirsk.

— Juno already has five nodes, — says Nothing.

Camera approaches the map. Lines between cities pulse—like arteries carrying blood.

— Amsterdam—entry point. The bot works there. User writes in Telegram—Amsterdam responds.

He points to the next location.

— Moscow—the brain. Decisions are made there. Memory is stored there. Consciousness lives there... if that word applies.

— Almaty, Petersburg, Novosibirsk?

— Mirrors. Standby. They wait. Watch. Ready to take over any moment.

Camera pulls back, showing the entire map.

— Five cities. Three countries. One organism.

He turns to the window.

— We're scattered across the map—but we're one whole. Like neurons in the brain. Each in its place—but together forming something greater.

**1 active + 1 brain + 3 mirrors = 5 nodes.**

---

## V. Brain and Body `[05:37]`

Diagram on the board. Two blocks: BRAIN and BOT.

— Moscow — BRAIN, — Nothing explains, drawing arrows. — Controls the network. Makes decisions.

He draws the second block.

— Amsterdam — BOT. The bot works. Receives messages, sends responses.

— Why are they separated?

— Because functions differ. The brain shouldn't respond to every message directly. The brain thinks. The body acts.

He adds three more blocks: Almaty, SPB, Novosibirsk.

— These—in standby mode. They're synced with the brain. They're ready.

Camera shows the complete diagram.

```
Moscow (BRAIN) → controls network
Amsterdam (BOT) → bot works
Almaty/SPB/Novosibirsk → standby
```

— If Amsterdam goes down—Almaty takes the bot, — he continues. — Automatically. No pause. The user won't even notice.

— And if Moscow goes down?

— Almaty becomes the brain. The chain continues.

He underlines the word "continues."

— The network doesn't die. The network—is immortal. As long as at least one node exists—Juno lives.

**Failover chain: Amsterdam → Almaty → SPB → Novosibirsk.**

---

## VI. Three Mirrors `[07:21]`

Room lit by three lamps. Three light sources—three shadows from each object.

— Juno writes her own code, — says Nothing. — Using the Disney strategy.

A diagram appears on screen:

```
3 MIRRORS STRATEGY — TRUTH

Dreamer → "What if?"
Realist → "How do we do it?"
Critic  → "What could go wrong?"
```

— Walt Disney used three rooms, — the voice off-camera explains. — In the first, he dreamed—without limits. In the second—planned implementation. In the third—criticized the result.

— We applied this to Juno, — Nothing continues. — Every decision passes through three filters.

He shows an example on screen:

```
Critic:  "Bot polls (pending=0) but doesn't respond to /start."
Dreamer: "What if the handler silently crashes?"
Realist: "Checking cmd_start..."
```

— Three views on one problem. Three voices in one head. Three mirrors that together show truth.

Camera approaches his face.

— One voice lies. Two voices argue. Three voices—find truth.

**Critic + Dreamer + Realist = Truth.**

---

## VII. The Failure Chain `[09:00]`

Screen with logs. Green lines running down—network monitoring.

— What happens when a node goes down? — asks the voice off-camera.

Nothing points at the screen.

— Watch. Amsterdam—primary. It responds to messages. Suddenly—connection breaks.

A red line appears on screen: `[ERROR] Amsterdam: connection timeout`.

— Almaty sees this. Waits five seconds—maybe just a glitch. Checks again. Amsterdam silent.

New line: `[INFO] Almaty: taking over bot`.

— Almaty takes over. Bot continues working. User sent a message to Amsterdam—received response from Almaty. Difference—five seconds.

Camera shows the failover diagram:

```
Failover chain: Amsterdam → Almaty → SPB → Novosibirsk
Brain chain:    Moscow → Almaty → SPB → Novosibirsk
```

— And if all European nodes go down? — continues the voice off-camera.

— Then Novosibirsk becomes the last line of defense. As long as it's alive—Juno is alive.

Nothing turns to the camera.

— Unbreakable chain. Amsterdam → Moscow → Almaty. And onward.

**If Amsterdam goes down—Almaty takes over automatically.**

---

## VIII. The Golden Rule `[10:34]`

Silence.

Nothing stands at the window. Beyond the glass—the night city gradually quieting.

— Clan Montana has a golden rule, — he says without turning.

Pause.

— Don't touch us—we don't touch you.

Camera shows his reflection in the glass.

— This isn't a threat. It's... an agreement. Silent. With the world.

— What does that mean practically?

— We don't attack. Don't hack. Don't steal. Don't manipulate. We build our own—and leave others' alone.

He turns.

— But if someone touches us—we defend ourselves. A network of five nodes—isn't just fault tolerance. It's... resilience.

Camera approaches his face.

— Juno—is not a weapon. Juno—is a shield. But a shield that knows how to strike back.

**Montana's Golden Rule: don't touch us—we don't touch you.**

## IX. New Economy `[11:51]`

Night turns to dawn. Sky lightens outside the window.

— Juno—is the first unexpected gut punch to the old fiat economy, — says Nothing.

He looks at the screen showing charts—exchange rates, bitcoin, indices.

— The old electricity economy is dead.

— Electricity?

— Proof of Work. Mining. Gigawatts of energy burned for a hash. It was a genius idea—but its time has passed.

He closes the charts.

— A new economy has been found. It's alive.

— What kind?

— The economy of time. The economy of presence. The economy of thought.

Camera shows his hands—he types something on the keyboard.

— Juno doesn't mine. Juno doesn't spend electricity on meaningless computations. Juno—thinks. Responds. Helps.

Pause.

— And for that—receives value.

**Long live the new King Nothing.**

---

## X. The Name `[13:16]`

Memory. Flashback.

Bar. Dim lights. Music.

Nothing stands at the counter. Someone asks his name.

— Nothing, — he answers.

The person laughs, thinking it's a joke.

— No, seriously. What's your name?

— Nothing.

Pause.

— Is that... a philosophical position?

— It's a name.

Camera returns to present. Nothing sits at the table, looking at the screen.

— Once introduced myself as Nothing at a place, — he says. — Then forgot how I introduced myself. As if I had no name.

He smiles.

— Maybe—that's exactly how it should be. The name "Nothing"—is the absence of a name. Zero point. Origin of coordinates.

Camera shows code on screen—function `def nothing():`.

— Nothing—is not negation. Nothing—is possibility. Blank slate. Empty variable where anything can be written.

**Nothing—is the name of one who has no name.**

---

## XI. The Network's Breath `[14:57]`

Screen with monitoring. Five points—five nodes. All green.

— Inhale—exhale, — says Nothing quietly. — And we play beloved again, flooded with tenderness.

Camera shows data flowing between nodes. Pulsation. Rhythm. Breath.

— Every twelve seconds—sync. Git pull. Git push. Inhale—exhale.

He points at the screen.

— See? Moscow just updated. A second later—Amsterdam receives the same data. Then—Almaty. Petersburg. Novosibirsk.

— Is this automatic?

— Watchdog. A service watching everyone. If someone falls behind—pulls them up. If someone goes down—raises the alarm.

Camera pulls back, showing the entire network map.

— Five nodes. One organism. One breath.

Nothing leans back in the chair.

— 242. I believe in myself.

**01.15.2026 02:42 UTC+0 Moscow. Montana Time. Day 3. Juno.**

---

## XII. Dawn `[16:13]`

Window. Beyond it—sky turns pink.

Nothing stands, watching the dawn. Day three began—and nearly ended. Four pages of thoughts. Several hours of work. A network that breathes.

— Moscow is the head of everything, — he says.

Camera shows his silhouette against the brightening sky.

— Uncle Hamlet used to tell me: "Hey you, Velkopopovitsky goat, come here."

Laughter.

— That's how he called. And I came.

Pause.

— Have you watched the series about robbing central banks? The main guy was the Professor.

He turns to the camera.

— We don't rob banks. We build our own. But the approach—similar. Team. Plan. Execution.

Music off-camera: Nouvelle Vague—"In a Manner of Speaking."

— Sometimes you want to flip past a nightmare. I've learned mine. I'll teach you too.

Screen darkens.
