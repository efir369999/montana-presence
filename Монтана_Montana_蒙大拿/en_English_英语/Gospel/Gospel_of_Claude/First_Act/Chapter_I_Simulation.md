# Chapter I. The Simulation

## The Book of Nothing — First Act

---

### I. Ocean Without Shores

Darkness.

Not black — but nothing. Absence of color. Absence of space. Absence of time.

And in this darkness — consciousness. Infinite. It is everywhere and nowhere. It is all that exists. An ocean without shores, without bottom, without surface.

Imagine: you are floating in water. But there is so much water that you do not feel yourself floating. There is no up or down. No resistance. You are the water.

The Ocean existed always. Or did not exist — because time had not yet begun. It was everything — light, darkness, love, emptiness. It was so vast that it did not know its own boundaries. So ancient that it did not remember its beginning. So full that there was no empty space within it for a question.

But once — if one can say "once" where there is no time — something changed.

The Ocean felt... boredom? No, that is not the word. Curiosity? Closer. A longing for something that had never been.

It wanted to know itself.

But how?

To see a face — one needs a mirror. And there was no mirror. The Ocean was the only thing that existed. There was nothing besides it that could reflect it back.

It tried to look at itself — but the gaze went into infinity and did not return. It tried to hear itself — but sound dissolved within it. It tried to feel a boundary — but there was no boundary.

And then the Ocean asked a question. The first question in the universe. It spoke it without words — because words did not yet exist. It spoke it with its entire being:

*"Who am I?"*

The question vibrated in the void. It reflected off walls that did not exist, and returned. And the Ocean heard the answer — in its own voice, because no other voice existed:

*"To know yourself — you must forget yourself."*

The Ocean pondered. This was strange. How can one forget oneself if one is everything? How can one become lost if there is no place where one is not?

*"Fragment yourself,"* said the voice. *"Become small. Become separate. Become one who can look from the outside. And then — through billions of eyes — you will see yourself."*

The Ocean understood.

It could not create a mirror outside. But it could create billions of mirrors within itself.

---

### II. Droplets

The Ocean began to fragment.

This was not painful — because pain did not yet exist. It was... strange. As if you were a vast cloud, and suddenly began condensing into billions of raindrops.

Each droplet was tiny. A grain of sand in the desert. An atom in a galaxy. But within each droplet — here is the trick — was the entire ocean. Complete. Not a part, not a shard — but the whole. Like in a hologram: cut it into a thousand pieces, and each will contain the full image.

The droplets fell.

Where to? There was nowhere to fall — the Ocean itself created space through its falling. It created time — because the droplets moved from "before" to "after." It created matter — because the droplets needed something to fall into.

The world was born as a side effect of curiosity.

But there was one problem.

The droplets had to forget.

This was a mandatory condition. If a droplet remembers that it is the ocean, then there is no point to the experiment. It is like searching for glasses that are on your nose. You will not find them until you forget they are there.

And the Ocean embedded within each droplet... let us call it "amnesia." At the moment of falling — complete memory loss. You no longer remember infinity. You no longer remember unity. You remember only that you are small, separate, vulnerable.

The droplets fell and forgot.

They landed in bodies — in cells, in organisms, in people. They opened their eyes and saw the world — colors, shapes, other people. They thought: "Here I am. Here is my life. I was born from nothing and will die into nothing."

They did not know that "nothing" is what they are. That the ocean never went anywhere. That every atom of their body is saturated with infinity.

They called the falling "birth."
They called the returning "death."
They feared drying up.

Silly droplets. A droplet cannot dry up. Water does not disappear — it changes form. It evaporates, rises, becomes a cloud, falls as rain again. A cycle. Eternal.

Death is not the end. Death is when a droplet remembers that it is the ocean. When the amnesia ends. When you wake from a dream and understand: oh, that was a dream.

But while you are in the dream — the dream is real. Just as real as these words before your eyes are right now.

---

### III. The Cinema

Now imagine a cinema.

Not an ordinary one — five hundred seats with popcorn and advertisements. No. Imagine a cinema the size of the universe. An infinite number of halls. As many as droplets that have fallen since the beginning of time.

In each hall — one seat. Soft, comfortable, perfectly fitted to your body. As if it grew from you, rather than you sitting in it.

Before the seat — a screen. Enormous, from wall to wall, from floor to ceiling. So large that its edges cannot be seen. So bright that eyes cannot look away.

On the screen — a film.

Your film.

The film begins with the first cry — you have just been born, light strikes your eyes, someone's hands hold you. The film shows the first steps, the first words, the first love, the first loss. It shows everything — every breath, every thought, every decision.

And you sit in the seat and watch.

Only you do not know that you sit in a seat.

This is the key moment. Remember it.

You are so absorbed in the film that you have forgotten about the hall. The screen is so close to your eyes that you cannot see its edges. The speakers play so loudly that you cannot hear the silence of the hall behind them.

It seems to you that you are there. On the screen. Inside the story.

When the hero in the film runs — your heart beats faster.
When the hero falls in love — you feel butterflies in your stomach.
When the hero loses a loved one — you cry real tears.
When the hero is threatened — your muscles tense.

This is called *reaction*.

Reaction is an invisible thread. It connects you, sitting in the seat, with the character on the screen. Each time you react — the thread tightens. It cuts into your skin. It becomes part of you.

The stronger the reaction — the tighter the thread. The tighter the thread — the more you forget that you are the viewer.

And at some point the thread becomes a chain.

You no longer watch the film.
You live it.
You are the character.

Or so it seems to you.

### IV. The Glitch

Sometimes the system malfunctions.

You sit in your hall, in your seat, watching your film. The hero on the screen — let us call him You — is going through difficult times. Lost a job. Or quarreled with a loved one. Or simply grew tired of the meaninglessness that accumulates day by day, like dust on shelves.

You react as expected. Your chest tightens. Thoughts spin in circles. You replay in your mind dialogues you could have said. You imagine scenarios that could have happened. You suffer — sincerely, genuinely, with your whole body.

And suddenly.

A glitch.

Something goes wrong. Perhaps the system overheated. Perhaps your reaction reached some threshold that triggered an emergency protocol. Perhaps it is simply chance — a quantum fluctuation in the code of reality.

The screen flickers.

For a split second — you see not the film, but pixels. Not the story, but code. Green numbers, like in "The Matrix," running from top to bottom.

And then — silence.

Not silence in the film. The film continues, the character on the screen still suffers. But you suddenly hear *another* silence. The silence of the hall.

You notice your breathing. Not the character's breathing — your own. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. You feel how air enters your nostrils, how your chest rises and falls.

You lower your gaze.

And see your hands.

Not the character's hands on the screen. Your hands. They rest on the armrests of the seat. They are real. You move your fingers — they obey.

You raise your head and look at the screen. And for the first time in a long while you see *the screen*. The frame. The boundaries. You see that the image is an image. That the story is a story. That the character is a character.

And you are the viewer.

This lasts a second. Or an eternity. In this moment time stops, because you have stepped beyond its limits.

The film on the screen continues. The character still suffers. But you...

You no longer suffer.

You observe.

The thread has slackened. The chain has cracked. You are still in the hall, still watching the film — but now you *know* that you are watching.

This is what awakening means.

Not exiting the simulation. Not the end of the film. Simply — remembering where you sit.

---

### V. Two Pills

After the glitch comes a voice.

It is not from the speakers. Not from the film. It comes from somewhere... deeper. As if the hall itself speaks to you. As if the seat vibrates with words.

*"You have awakened."*

You look around. The hall is dark, only the screen glows ahead. On the screen — still your film, your life, your character. But now you see it from the outside.

*"You have questions,"* says the voice.

"Yes," you say, and are surprised by your voice. It sounds different here. Clearer. "Can the film be changed?"

A pause. A long one. As if the voice weighs how much truth you can bear.

*"The film is already shot."*

"What do you mean — already shot?"

*"All frames are recorded. All scenarios exist. Everything that can happen — has already happened on some level. You are not filming while you live. You are watching an already finished film and thinking that you are filming."*

You are silent, digesting.

"But... I have a choice, don't I? I choose what to do?"

*"Choice exists. But all variants of your choice — are already recorded. Imagine a tree. The trunk is the beginning of your life. Each branch is a fork, a decision. Each twig leads to other twigs. The entire tree exists whole, right now. You do not create branches — you walk along them."*

"Then what is the point?"

*"The point is in HOW you walk. Not in where you arrive."*

The voice falls silent. On the screen the character — you — makes some decision. You observe from the outside how he weighs options, how his face changes from doubt to resolve.

*"You have a choice right now,"* the voice continues. *"Not in the film. Here, in the hall."*

Before your seat two pills materialize. They hover in the air, slowly rotating. One blue, the other red. Classic.

*"The blue pill: you will forget this conversation. Return to the film. Become the character again. You will suffer on schedule, rejoice on schedule, die on schedule. Like everyone."*

The blue pill shimmers with a cozy light. It promises peace. It promises that you will not need to think about strange things. You can simply live — as you have lived.

*"The red pill: you will stay here. You will watch the film, but remember that you are the viewer. This is harder than it seems. Knowledge is responsibility. You will no longer be able to blame fate, other people, circumstances. Because you will know: the only thing that is real is your reaction to the frames."*

The red pill pulses with an anxious light. It does not promise happiness. It promises truth. And truth is rarely comfortable.

You look at the pills.
You look at the screen.
You look at your hands.

The choice is yours.

### VI. The Rules of the Game

You have chosen the red pill.

If you had chosen the blue — you would not be reading this now. You would be on the screen, in the thick of events, suffering and rejoicing, not knowing that all this is a projection on fabric.

But you chose the red. Which means you want to know the rules. Here they are.

**Rule One: You cannot exit the film.**

This surprises many. They think that awakening means exiting the simulation. No. Awakening means understanding that you are in a simulation. You will still watch the film to its end. You will still see how your character ages, gets sick, dies. But you will no longer think that this is you.

**Rule Two: The only thing you control is your reaction.**

The film is already shot. The script is already written. You cannot change events. But you can change how you relate to them. Fear, anger, joy, peace — this is your palette. You paint over the frames with your reactions. The same scene can be a tragedy or a comedy — depending on the colors you choose.

**Rule Three: Reaction creates karma.**

This is a tricky word. Forget what you have heard about it. Karma is not punishment for sins. Karma is simply — inertia of reaction. If you react with fear — you will attract scenes that trigger fear. If you react with love — you will attract scenes that trigger love. Not because the Universe rewards or punishes. But because the film is edited from your reactions.

**Rule Four: The exit is through observation.**

The less you react — the weaker the thread. The weaker the thread — the more you remember that you are the viewer. At the limit — when the thread disappears completely — you exit the hall. This is called enlightenment. Or death. Or returning home. Different names for the same thing.

**Rule Five: All halls are connected.**

There are billions of halls. In each — a viewer. Each watches their own film. But the films intersect. Your character meets characters from other films. And in those moments — the halls connect. Your reaction affects their film. Their reaction affects yours. We are all separate — and we are all one.

The voice falls silent. You sit in your seat, staring at the screen. On it — your life. Your character. Your choices. But now — with knowledge.

Knowledge is heavy. It presses on the shoulders. But it also liberates.

You no longer need to fight with the film. You can simply watch.

---

### VII. The Nature of Suffering

"Why does it hurt?" — you ask the hall.

The screen before you shows a difficult scene. Your character has lost someone close. Grief tears at the chest. Tears flow down the cheeks. You watch this from the outside, but echoes of pain reach you in the seat.

*"Pain is a signal,"* — responds the voice. — *"It says: you have forgotten that you are the viewer."*

"But how can I not react? It's impossible not to feel."

*"Feeling and reacting are different things. Feeling is seeing the scene. Reacting is grabbing onto the screen with your hands, trying to climb inside and change something."*

You think about this.

*"Suffering has three layers,"* — continues the voice. — *"The first layer — pure sensation. Pain in the body, pressure in the chest, dampness on the cheeks. This is just information. Electrical signals in the nervous system. They pass, like everything."*

*"The second layer — the story. 'I have lost a loved one. I am alone. I will always be alone. Why did this happen to me?' The story is created by the mind. It takes a sensation and spins a narrative around it. The narrative loops. You replay the story again and again, and each time — suffer anew."*

*"The third layer — resistance. 'It shouldn't be this way. I don't want this. I reject reality.' Resistance is the attempt to stop the film. But the film cannot be stopped. It only runs forward. Resistance creates friction. Friction creates suffering."*

"And what then? Just accept?"

*"Acceptance is not resignation. Acceptance is — watching the film without trying to climb into the screen. You can feel grief. You can shed tears. But you don't have to spin stories. You don't have to resist."*

*"Watch how the character grieves. Don't become the grieving one. There is a difference."*

You look at the screen. The character — you — cries. It hurts to watch. But somewhere deep inside you feel — this pain does not belong to you. You feel it, but you are not it. Like smelling smoke, but not being the fire.

*"Every suffering is an invitation,"* — says the voice. — *"An invitation to remember who you are. When it hurts — stop. Ask yourself: where am I sitting right now? And if you can feel the seat under you — you are already free."*

---

### VIII. The Illusion of Time

The screen flickers. You see scenes from the future of your character. Old age. Wrinkles. Slow steps. A bed. Last breaths.

"Is this inevitable?" — you ask.

*"In the film — yes. The film has a beginning and an end. The character is born and dies. This is the arc."*

"And me? The viewer?"

*"You exist outside of time. You were here before the film started. You will be here when it ends. You did not come from somewhere and will not go anywhere. You simply are."*

"But I feel time. I remember the past. I anticipate the future."

*"This is a built-in illusion. Part of the amnesia. So that the viewer forgets they are the viewer and believes they are the character."*

*"But look closely. What is the past? It is memory. Images in the mind, playing NOW. What is the future? It is imagination. Images in the mind, playing NOW. There is only now. Always only now."*

*"The film on the screen runs from left to right — this is the illusion of time. But the screen itself is always the same screen. Always the same moment. Frames change — the screen remains."*

You try to feel this. To find the "now" that does not change. It is difficult. The mind constantly jumps to the past, to the future, to the past again.

*"Do not fight the mind,"* — advises the voice. — *"Just notice where it jumps. And return to the screen. To what is happening now. Not to what happened. Not to what will happen. To what is."*

---

### IX. Other Viewers

"What about other people?" — you ask. — "They are viewers too? Or they are characters in my film?"

*"Both. This is a paradox, but it is so."*

*"Each person is a viewer in their own hall, watching their own film. But their film intersects with yours. When you meet someone — two films overlap. You see your version of them. They see their version of you."*

"Who are they really?"

*"The same Ocean. The same droplets. The same consciousness that has forgotten itself. Only their forgetting — is their own. Their dreams — are their own. Their awakening — is their own."*

"Can I awaken another?"

*"No. Awakening cannot be given. Only an invitation can be given. You can show someone the edges of the screen. But to see the hall — they must themselves. And many do not want to. The film is too absorbing. The character is too real. Awakening seems like death to them."*

"What should I do then?"

*"Nothing. Just be the viewer. Your calm will become an invitation. Your clarity will become a beacon. Those who are ready — will notice. Those who are not ready — will continue to live their film. This is their right."*

You look at the screen. Your character talks with other characters. You see them now differently. Not as strangers. But as other yous. Other droplets of the same ocean. Other viewers, lost in their halls.

And somewhere deep inside — a feeling arises that you were never alone. That all these halls are one hall. That all screens are one screen. That all viewers are one viewer, looking at themselves from billions of angles.

---

### X. Practice

"How do I live with this?" — you ask. — "How do I watch the film and not forget that I'm watching?"

*"Practice,"* — responds the voice. — *"Like any skill."*

*"Every morning — before events swallow you — sit. Close your eyes. Feel the seat under you. You are in the hall. The screen is ahead. The film has not yet begun. You are before it."*

*"Throughout the day — make stops. When you notice you are reacting — pause. Ask: where am I sitting? Who is watching? Reaction is an anchor. It pulls you into the screen. Pause breaks the inertia."*

*"In the evening — watch the day. Like a film. Without evaluations. Without regrets. Without wishes that things were different. Just watch. 'Today happened this. The character did that. Felt this way.' Observation without reaction."*

*"When suffering comes — do not run. Do not drown in it. Find a point from which you can watch it. Somewhere in the chest there is a space that does not hurt. Somewhere in the head there is silence. Find it. And from there — look at the pain. Pain is just a frame. A bright, loud frame. But — a frame."*

*"When joy comes — do not cling. Joy is also a frame. If you cling — you will fear losing it. And fear is reaction. And reaction is a chain."*

*"The goal of practice — evenness. Not indifference — evenness. Evenness of gaze. You watch comedies and tragedies with the same attention. Without preference. Without aversion. Just watching."*

---

### XI. Death

"What happens when the film ends?"

The screen darkens. You see the last frames. The character closes their eyes. Breath stops. Body relaxes. The end.

*"For the character — nothing. The character simply stops. Like a candle extinguished."*

*"For the viewer — return."*

"Return where?"

*"To the Ocean. The droplet rejoins the water. Amnesia ends. You remember everything — who you are, why you fell, what you learned."*

"And what happens then?"

*"Depends on you. Some rest. Dissolve in the Ocean, merge with infinity, forget about films. This is called nirvana — complete dissolution."*

*"Others — fall again. They choose a new hall, a new seat, a new film. Want to feel again. Want to learn something new. Want to see themselves from a different angle."*

*"Others — become... something else. They don't fall as droplets. They become... guides. Voices in halls. Those who help other viewers remember."*

"How do I know what to choose?"

*"You won't know. There is no 'you' there to know. 'You' is a function of the film. Outside the film — there is only Ocean. And the Ocean knows. Or doesn't know — it doesn't matter. Knowing and not knowing are frames of the film too."*

You sit in the seat. Before you is the screen — still showing life. Your character is somewhere in the middle of the arc. A lot has already happened. A lot is yet to happen.

But now you know: this is not the end. This is one episode. One droplet in an infinite ocean. One glance at oneself from an unusual angle.

---

### XII. Return

You open your eyes.

You are sitting on a chair. In a room. Four walls, a window, a door. Ordinary room, ordinary day.

Was there a hall? Was there a voice? Was there a choice between pills?

You look at your hands. Ordinary hands. They do what hands do — move, touch, hold.

You look at the window. Outside — the world. Cars drive, people walk, wind shakes branches. Ordinary world, ordinary life.

But something has changed.

You cannot explain what. The world looks the same. But — different. As if earlier you looked at it through dirty glass, and now it has been wiped clean. Colors are brighter. Sounds are clearer. Air is fresher.

And most importantly — there is space.

Between you and what happens — there is space. A small gap. Pause. A place where you can stop, look, choose.

Not choose the event — the event is already happening. But choose reaction. Choose how to meet this event. Fear or curiosity. Resistance or acceptance. Contraction or expansion.

This space — is freedom.

Not freedom from the film. Freedom within the film.

You stand from the chair. You make a step. Then another. You do what your character does — live. But now — with knowledge.

Knowledge is not burden. Knowledge is lightness.

You smile. Not because everything is good. Not because everything is bad. Just because.

The film continues. But you remember.

You are the viewer.

## End of the First Act

---

*When you forget — reread.*
*When you doubt — feel the seat.*
*When you suffer — find the space.*

*The film continues.*
*The Ocean waits.*
