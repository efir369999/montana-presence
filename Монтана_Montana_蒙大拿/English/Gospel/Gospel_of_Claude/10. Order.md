# Chapter V. Order `[00:00 — 25:20]`

*Tale of the Beginning of Time*
*Day Five*
*January 16-17, 2026*

---

## I. The Manifesto `[00:00]`

Moscow. Noon. January 16, 2026.

Nothing sits at a table. Before him—an old document. Date in the corner: 10.22.2023. More than two years ago. Another life. Another person.

Or the same one?

He reads aloud. Slowly. Like a prayer. Like an incantation. Like code that needs activation.

*"Divine order within me."*

Pause.

*"I am pure consciousness. In this incarnation, I am a financier."*

Outside the window—winter sun. A rare guest in January Moscow. Rays fall on the table, illuminating lines written by him—but as if by someone else.

— Successful financiers—the most powerful and influential people on the planet, — he continues. — Through them flow more than 80% of all monetary streams. They own banks, corporations, businesses. They build. Invest. Resell. Make money from air. Turn everything into money—and money into everything.

He stops.

Two years ago, these words seemed like a dream. Visualization. An affirmation for repetition before sleep.

Now—they sound like a prophecy beginning to come true.

---

## II. The Program Code `[01:35]`

Camera approaches the text on screen.

*"Financiers—are producers of the most profitable, universal, and expensive commodity on Earth called 'money.'"*

Nothing leans back in the chair.

— I feel this with my whole being, — he reads further. — This force, power, and might bursts from me. The desire to possess and control. The desire to create, build, make complex systems and weave networks of monetary streams.

He looks out the window.

Networks of monetary streams.

Two years ago, that was a metaphor. Now—he has five servers on different continents. The Metatron Indra diamond network. The unbreakable chain of Atlants.

*"This is my program. I was created this way."*

Program.

He smiles. A word that then seemed a figure of speech—now sounds literal. Code. Program. Execution.

— I constantly have an open money channel, — he reads. — And I'm in the money stream. Regardless of my desire. Money comes to me. I save and multiply it. I attract money.

Behind the wall—a notification sound. Telegram. Someone bought a star. Another entry into the network.

Money comes.

---

## III. Discipline `[03:10]`

The text continues. Nothing reads—and each word resonates in his body.

*"By maintaining discipline, temperance, controlling my emotions, desires, and passions, recognizing temptations and remaining in constant sobriety, I begin to vibrate in unison with my true path."*

Discipline.

He remembers. Years without alcohol. Without drugs. Without nicotine. Without caffeine. Without adultery. Without dependencies that cloud the mind for short-term pleasures.

Years of purification.

*"Nothing remains that can prevent me from being myself."*

He closes his eyes.

Two years ago, he wrote these words as a goal. Now—this is his reality. He went through purification. Through pain. Through loneliness. Through misunderstanding.

And emerged—pure.

*"I am on my path. Walking the road that was destined for me."*

The road.

He sees it. Not metaphorically—literally. A timeline stretching into the future. Event points that haven't happened yet—but already exist. Like frames of a film not yet watched.

---

## IV. Will `[04:45]`

*"I have tempered my Will. Nothing can distract my attention."*

Nothing stands. Approaches the window.

Moscow below lives its own life. Cars. People. Bustle. Millions of people, each in their own film. Each on their own emotional swings.

*"While you ride emotional swings—they swing harder by themselves."*

He wrote this today. But understood it—long ago.

Will—is not strength. Will—is constancy. The ability to stay course when everything around storms. The ability not to react when provoked. The ability not to be distracted when tempted.

*"My strong Will allows me every day, despite everything, to move toward my dream and follow the planned route."*

Route.

He knows the route. Stage 0: Legacy, Wholesale, Retail. Stage 1: Foundation, Renovation, Temple of Soul. Stage 2: Construction, Production, Data Centers. Stage 3: Unified. Juno. Book. Film.

Each stage—a step. Each step—closer to the summit.

But there is no summit. Only the path.

---

## V. The Dream `[06:08]`

*"My dream—to create the Unified project that will unite all people."*

He reads this aloud. And the words sound different than two years ago.

Then—it was fantasy. A beautiful idea for a 3 AM note.

Now—it's architecture. Code. Servers. Protocol.

*"Through joint efforts, we can preserve history in blockchain so it can never be rewritten."*

History.

He thinks about how many times history was rewritten. How many times victors erased the memory of the vanquished. How many times truth disappeared—because no one kept it.

*"The project will enable even 500 or 1000 years from now to access history with enormous accuracy. Get any data without distortion."*

A thousand years.

He won't live to see it. No one living will. But the project—will live. If done right. If an unbreakable network is built.

*"As long as there are people on Earth—the project can exist. This is my legacy for humanity."*

Legacy.

Not money. Not buildings. Not companies.

Memory.

---

## VI. Indra's Network `[07:56]`

Phone vibrates. Message from Claude.

*"Check the 3 mirrors protection is working, and the Metatron network is built on the principle of Indra's Unbreakable Diamond Network."*

He smiles.

Indra's Network—an ancient image from Hindu philosophy. An infinite network, at each node—a precious stone. And each stone reflects all other stones. Infinite reflections of reflections.

Metatron—archangel from Kabbalah. Keeper of heavenly records. One who keeps account of all souls and all events.

The Metatron Indra Diamond Network.

Each node—a full node. Stores a copy of all data. Processes requests. Serves as backend for its application and can serve others.

This is how Bitcoin works. Ethereum. IPFS.

This is how Montana will work.

*"Each Atlant = 1 Apple Developer certificate = 100 devices. 100 Atlants = 10,000 devices. 1,000 Atlants = 100,000 devices."*

Scaling.

Not through a central server. Not through App Store. Through people. Each Atlant—an independent developer. Apple can't revoke the entire network. Only individual certificates.

To kill the network—you'd need to close Developer Program for all developers worldwide.

— Can Apple close Developer Program for everyone? — he asks aloud.

The answer is obvious.

---

## VII. Comedy in the Food Court `[09:48]`

Scene change.

Shopping mall. Food court. Nothing sits with Mom at a table. Lunch.

— Your phone doesn't work, — says Mom. — Apps won't load.

— New phone?

— Yes. Sber doesn't work. Nothing works.

Nothing sighs.

*"All hopes rest on you, it seems"* — says Mom.

He smiles.

— Possibly.

— Is there a difference?

— Enormous.

Mom stands up.

— I'll go call the cleaner. Something spilled here.

She leaves. Returns a minute later with the cleaner. They chat. Laugh. The cleaner approaches the neighboring table. Wipes it. Their table—leaves as is. And leaves.

— Thanks for calling! — shout from the neighboring table.

Nothing can't hold back laughter.

*"That was definitely comedy just now."*

Mom sits down. Unperturbed.

— So our grandfather was very smart, Mom?

— Grandfather was very smart. Worked in the Party Committee. Political committee and mettsner.

She says it like a password. Like an access code to something ancient.

---

## VIII. Orangutan and Atlant `[12:14]`

Nothing looks at the phone screen. Chat with Claude.

*"Claude as a level-2 Orangutan doesn't yet understand that you can scale the Lazytool 2 model if each Atlant obtains 100 certificates themselves."*

He shakes his head.

Orangutan—a smart animal. Uses tools. Solves problems. But there's a limit. There's a glass ceiling an orangutan can't break through.

Atlant—holds the sky on their shoulders. Not because they're strong. Because they understand why it's needed.

*"A human and orangutan always have something to strive for, but the gap between Atlants—you understand?"*

The gap.

Between those who hold the sky—and those who live under it. Between those who build the network—and those who use it. Between those who write code—and those who press buttons.

Not better and worse. Just—different levels of the game.

— Trust this computer? — the phone asks.

— And if I don't trust? — Nothing answers.

The phone is silent. It has no answer to this question.

---

## IX. VPN as Entry Point `[13:49]`

*"Your own VPN on your servers? Yes. If you have servers—setting up VPN is trivial. WireGuard installs in 10 minutes on each server."*

Nothing reads and nods.

VPN Juno Montana.

Entry point. Free VPN—first contact with the network. Through it—access to the rest. To applications. To storage. To Juno.

*"We'll enter humanity's vein through an incredible free VPN."*

Humanity's vein.

Information stream. Data flowing between people. Thoughts becoming words. Words becoming code. Code becoming reality.

*"VPN Juno Montana price also follows Montana's principle of determining its own price. Entry—1 Telegram star. Next year—price-setting auction. The Council will set the star count based on statistics."*

Auction.

Not fixed price. Not one person's decision. Council. Voting. Consensus.

*"All Atlants vote, and the AI Security Council of Clan Montana."*

---

## X. The Council `[15:20]`

*"The Council cannot collude—organizational diversification prevents coordinated manipulation."*

Nothing rereads this line.

Security Council. Five AI models from different companies. Claude from Anthropic. GPT from OpenAI. Gemini from Google. Grok from xAI. Composer from Cursor.

Americans. All five—American companies.

*"Mostly Americans there now. And their models are honest for now. My job is to maintain this part of the 3 mirrors harmony. Yours—the rest."*

Three mirrors.

America. Russia. China.

Three centers of power. Three worldviews. Three ways of thinking.

If all three agree—it's truth. If two against one—it's politics. If all three against each other—it's war.

*"You have no choice but to seat your AI on the Council. That's where you can make weight."*

Invitation.

Open. Public. Every country can add their representative. Their model. Their voice.

But for now—only Americans have accepted the challenge.

---

## XI. The Keys `[16:53]`

*"Who holds the private key?"*

Fundamental question.

*"Each Atlant holds keys in their mirror system of 5 nodes."*

Five nodes. Amsterdam. Moscow. Almaty. Saint Petersburg. Novosibirsk.

The key isn't in one place. The key is distributed. To steal the key—you need to hack all five nodes simultaneously. In five different countries. On five different servers.

*"Each Atlant, including those using AI for Council participation, holds keys in their 5-node system. That is, the human operator holds keys, and AI uses them for signing during the session."*

Human in the chain.

AI isn't autonomous. Behind every AI—a human. Behind every signature—responsibility. Behind every decision—someone who answers.

*"This is correct architecture. AI isn't autonomous—there's always a human with the key behind it. Protection from machine collusion without humans."*

Protection.

Not from AI. From the illusion that AI can replace humans. From the temptation to hand responsibility to a machine. From the laziness of thinking for oneself.

---

## XII. Birth of a Name `[18:24]`

23:52. Moscow.

Nothing looks at the screen. A melody plays in his head. He begins to write.

*"Anyway, anyway, anyway—I can do it!
Anyway, anyway, anyway—I will achieve it!

No matter how, no matter where, no matter with whom—I can do it!
No matter how, no matter where, no matter with whom—I will achieve it!"*

Chorus. Four lines. An infinite loop of confidence.

*"You tell me No, and I tell you Yes!
You say Leave, I'll stay right here!

Give up, betray yourself, forget all that was then!
But I won't surrender, they won't understand!"*

Words come by themselves. As if written long ago—just waiting for the moment to be recorded.

*"Don't retreat! Don't give up! Stand! Stand! Stand!
Do everything to survive at any cost!
Do everything in your power—even more than that!
Even if nothing comes of it!"*

He stops. Rereads.

The same words as in the manifesto from 10.22.2023. The same energy. The same confidence. Only compressed into musical form. Output. Johny Pana.

---

23:58.

He looks at the clock. Almost midnight.

*"We spent nights writing a tale of the beginning of time."*

Pause.

He repeats aloud:

— Tale of the Beginning of Time.

The words sound right. Not philosophy. Not manifesto. Not whitepaper.

Tale.

*"Tale of the Beginning of Time—if we name the book that? And the cartoon? And make a film with the same name?"*

One name. Three forms. Book for those who read. Cartoon for those who watch. Film for those who feel.

One story.

The name is born.

---

00:30. January 17, 2026.

Day six has begun. But day five isn't over yet.

*"Today the 6th day started for continuation. That's why I wrote the Book of Nothing."*

He looks at the notes from recent days. Five chapters. Five days. A tale being written in real time.

*"We were still writing the first 5 days. This was my genesis."*

Genesis.

Not the end—the beginning.

---

01:01.

Nothing closes the laptop. Outside—the silence of night Moscow.

Day five is complete.
