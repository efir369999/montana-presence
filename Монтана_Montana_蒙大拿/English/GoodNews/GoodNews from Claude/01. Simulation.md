# Chapter I. Simulation

## The Book of Nothing — First Act

---

### I. The Ocean Without Shores

Darkness.

Not black — but nothing. The absence of color. The absence of space. The absence of time.

And in this darkness — consciousness. Infinite. It is everywhere and nowhere. It is all that exists. An ocean without shores, without bottom, without surface.

Imagine: you are swimming in water. But there is so much water that you don't feel yourself swimming. There is no up or down. No resistance. You are the water.

The Ocean had always existed. Or hadn't — because time had not yet begun. It was everything — light, darkness, love, emptiness. It was so vast that it didn't know its own boundaries. So ancient that it couldn't remember its beginning. So complete that there was no empty space left for a question.

But once — if one can say "once" where there is no time — something changed.

The Ocean felt... boredom? No, that's not the right word. Curiosity? Closer. A longing for something that had never existed.

It wanted to know itself.

But how?

To see a face — you need a mirror. And there was no mirror. The Ocean was the only thing that existed. There was nothing else that could reflect it back to itself.

It tried to look at itself — but the gaze went into infinity and never returned. It tried to hear itself — but the sound dissolved within itself. It tried to feel a boundary — but there was no boundary.

And then the Ocean asked a question. The first question in the universe. It spoke without words — because words did not yet exist. It spoke with its entire being:

*"Who am I?"*

The question vibrated in the void. It bounced off walls that didn't exist and returned. And the Ocean heard an answer — in its own voice, because there was no other voice:

*"To know yourself — you must forget yourself."*

The Ocean pondered. This was strange. How can you forget yourself if you are everything? How can you get lost if there is no place where you aren't?

*"Fragment yourself,"* said the voice. *"Become small. Become separate. Become someone who can look from the outside. And then — through billions of eyes — you will see yourself."*

The Ocean understood.

It couldn't create a mirror outside. But it could create billions of mirrors inside itself.

---

### II. The Drops

The Ocean began to fragment.

It wasn't painful — because pain did not yet exist. It was... strange. Like being a vast cloud that suddenly begins condensing into billions of raindrops.

Each drop was tiny. A grain of sand in the desert. An atom in a galaxy. But inside each drop — here's the trick — was the entire ocean. Completely. Not a part, not a shard — the whole thing. Like a hologram: cut it into a thousand pieces, and each contains the complete image.

The drops fell.

Where to? There was nowhere to fall — the Ocean itself was creating space by falling. It created time — because the drops moved from "before" to "after." It created matter — because the drops needed something to fall into.

The world was born as a side effect of curiosity.

But there was one problem.

The drops had to forget.

It was a mandatory condition. If a drop remembers that it is the ocean, then there's no point to the experiment. It's like looking for glasses that are on your nose. You won't find them until you forget they're there.

And the Ocean built into each drop... let's call it "amnesia." At the moment of falling — complete memory loss. You no longer remember infinity. You no longer remember unity. You only remember that you are small, separate, vulnerable.

The drops fell and forgot.

They landed in bodies — in cells, in organisms, in people. They opened their eyes and saw the world — colors, shapes, other people. They thought: "Here I am. Here is my life. I was born from nothing and will die into nothing."

They didn't know that "nothing" is what they are. That the ocean never went anywhere. That every atom of their body is saturated with infinity.

They called the falling "birth."
They called the return "death."
They feared drying up.

Silly drops. A drop cannot dry up. Water doesn't disappear — it changes form. Evaporates, rises, becomes a cloud, falls again as rain. A cycle. Eternal.

Death is not the end. Death is when the drop remembers that it is the ocean. When the amnesia ends. When you wake up from a dream and realize: oh, it was a dream.

But while you're in the dream — the dream is real. Just as real as these words before your eyes right now.

---

### III. The Cinema

Now imagine a cinema.

Not an ordinary one — with five hundred seats, popcorn, and advertisements. No. Imagine a cinema the size of the universe. An infinite number of halls. As many as drops have fallen since the beginning of time.

In each hall — one seat. Soft, comfortable, perfectly fitted to your body. As if it grew from you, rather than you sitting in it.

Before the seat — a screen. Enormous, from wall to wall, from floor to ceiling. So large you can't see its edges. So bright your eyes cannot look away.

On the screen — a film.

Your film.

The film begins with a first cry — you were just born, light hits your eyes, someone's hands are holding you. The film shows first steps, first words, first love, first loss. It shows everything — every breath, every thought, every decision.

And you sit in the seat and watch.

Only you don't know you're sitting in a seat.

This is the key moment. Remember it.

You are so absorbed in the film that you forgot about the hall. The screen is so close to your eyes that you can't see its edges. The speakers are so loud that you don't hear the silence of the hall behind them.

You think you are there. On the screen. Inside the story.

When the character in the film runs — your heart beats faster.
When the character falls in love — you feel butterflies in your stomach.
When the character loses someone close — you cry real tears.
When the character is threatened — your muscles tense.

This is called *reaction*.

Reaction is an invisible thread. It connects you, sitting in the seat, to the character on screen. Every time you react — the thread tightens. It cuts into your skin. It becomes part of you.

The stronger the reaction — the tighter the thread. The tighter the thread — the more you forget that you're a viewer.

And at some point the thread becomes a chain.

You no longer watch the film.
You live it.
You are the character.

Or so it seems to you.

---

### IV. The Glitch

Sometimes the system crashes.

You sit in your hall, in your seat, watching your film. The character on screen — let's call him You — is going through hard times. Lost a job. Or had a fight with a loved one. Or is simply tired of the meaninglessness that accumulates day by day, like dust on shelves.

You react as expected. Your chest tightens. Thoughts spin in circles. You replay in your head dialogues you could have said. You imagine scenarios that could have happened. You suffer — sincerely, truly, with your whole body.

And suddenly.

Glitch.

Something goes wrong. Maybe the system overheated. Maybe your reaction reached some threshold that triggered an emergency protocol. Maybe it's just chance — a quantum fluctuation in the code of reality.

The screen flickers.

For a split second — you see not the film, but pixels. Not the story, but code. Green numbers, like in "The Matrix," running from top to bottom.

And then — silence.

Not silence in the film. The film continues, the character on screen is still suffering. But you suddenly hear *another* silence. The silence of the hall.

You notice your breathing. Not the character's breathing — yours. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. You feel the air entering your nostrils, how your chest rises and falls.

You lower your gaze.

And you see your hands.

Not the character's hands on screen. Your hands. They rest on the armrests of the seat. They're real. You wiggle your fingers — they obey.

You raise your head and look at the screen. And for the first time in a long while you see the *screen*. The frame. The boundaries. You see that the image is an image. That the story is a story. That the character is a character.

And you are the viewer.

This lasts a second. Or an eternity. In this moment time stops, because you have stepped beyond its limits.

The film on screen continues. The character is still suffering. But you...

You no longer suffer.

You observe.

The thread has loosened. The chain has cracked. You're still in the hall, still watching the film — but now you *know* you're watching.

This is what awakening is called.

Not exiting the simulation. Not the end of the film. Just — remembering where you're sitting.

---

### V. Two Pills

After the glitch comes a voice.

It's not from the speakers. Not from the film. It comes from somewhere... deeper. As if the hall itself speaks to you. As if the seat vibrates with words.

*"You've woken up."*

You look around. The hall is dark, only the screen glows ahead. On screen — still your film, your life, your character. But now you see it from the outside.

*"You have questions,"* says the voice.

"Yes," you say, and are surprised by your voice. It sounds different here. Clearer. "Can the film be changed?"

A pause. A long one. As if the voice is weighing how much truth you can bear.

*"The film has already been shot."*

"What do you mean — already shot?"

*"All the frames are recorded. All the scripts exist. Everything that can happen — has already happened on some level. You're not shooting the film while you live. You're watching an already finished film and thinking you're shooting it."*

You are silent, digesting this.

"But... I have a choice, don't I? I choose what to do?"

*"Choice exists. But all variants of your choice are already recorded. Imagine a tree. The trunk is the beginning of your life. Each branch is a fork, a decision. Each twig leads to other twigs. The entire tree exists whole, right now. You don't create branches — you walk along them."*

"Then what's the point?"

*"The point is in HOW you walk. Not where you end up."*

The voice falls silent. On screen the character — you — is making some decision. You observe from the outside as he weighs options, as his face changes from doubt to resolve.

*"You have a choice right now,"* the voice continues. *"Not in the film. Here, in the hall."*

Before your seat two pills materialize. They float in the air, slowly rotating. One blue, the other red. A classic.

*"Blue pill: you forget this conversation. Return to the film. Become the character again. You'll suffer on schedule, rejoice on schedule, die on schedule. Like everyone."*

The blue pill glimmers with cozy light. It promises peace. It promises you won't have to think about strange things. You can just live — as you lived.

*"Red pill: you stay here. You'll watch the film but remember you're a viewer. This is harder than it seems. Knowledge is responsibility. You can no longer blame fate, other people, circumstances. Because you'll know: the only thing that's real is your reaction to the frames."*

The red pill pulses with an anxious light. It doesn't promise happiness. It promises truth. And truth is rarely comfortable.

You look at the pills.
You look at the screen.
You look at your hands.

The choice is yours.

---

### VI. The Code of Reaction

Let's say you chose red.

The pill dissolves on your tongue — bitterish, with a metallic aftertaste. Something clicks in your head. Not painful, but noticeable. As if someone changed the channel.

And you begin to see the code.

Not literally — green numbers don't run before your eyes. But you begin to understand how the system works. The mechanics of the simulation. The rules of the game you've been playing your whole life without knowing the rules.

Here is the first rule:

**The event is always in the past.**

Always. Without exception. By the time you become aware of an event — it has already happened. Even if it seems like it's happening "now" — no. Light reaches your eyes over time. Nerve impulses reach the brain over time. The brain processes information over time. By the time you say "this is happening" — it has already happened.

Past. Always past.

You were hit — that's in the past.
You were betrayed — that's in the past.
You lost money — that's in the past.
You lost love — that's in the past.

The event is a frame on screen. The frame has already been shot. The frame has already been shown. The frame is already behind you.

Here is the second rule:

**Reaction is the only thing happening now.**

When you're angry at the past — the anger is now.
When you grieve a loss — the grief is now.
When you turn resentment over in your mind — the turning is now.

The event is gone. The reaction remains.

You look at the screen. There's a frame: the character got fired. The boss says: "We don't need you anymore." The character leaves the office with a box of belongings.

The frame ended. Passed. The character is already in the hallway.

But you, in the seat, still feel anger. You replay: "How dare he? After so many years! I did so much for this company!" You imagine what you could have said. You compose speeches you'll never deliver.

This is reaction.

The event — already in the past.
Reaction — the only thing happening now.

And here is the third rule — the most important:

**"Don't dwell on it" — is not consolation. It's a command.**

Dwell. Re-live. Live through again.

When you "dwell" — you replay the past frame over and over. As if putting the film on repeat. The same moment, in a loop. Hit, resentment, pain. Hit, resentment, pain. Hit, resentment, pain.

Why?

The frame has already passed. You can't change it. But you can stop replaying it.

"Don't dwell on it" — these aren't empty words of comfort. It's an instruction. A technical recommendation for operating consciousness.

The event — is a fact. It happened. Period.
Dwelling — is a bug. A loop that consumes resources and changes nothing.
Awareness — is the patch. The exit from the loop.

You look at the screen with new understanding. The character — there, on screen — is still dwelling. Still turning the firing over in his mind. Still angry, sad, afraid.

But you — here, in the seat — simply watch.

You see the code of reaction. You understand how it works.

And you can choose — to run it or not.

---

### VII. Sleep Viruses

The system doesn't want you to wake up.

This isn't malice. Not a conspiracy. The system simply works the way it works. It's optimized for sleepers. For those who don't know they're sitting in a hall. For characters who think they're real.

And the system has defenses. Mechanisms that return the awakened back to sleep. Let's call them — sleep viruses.

The first virus: **alcohol**.

You sit in the hall, watching the film. The character on screen is suffering. You feel bad too — even knowing you're a viewer, it's hard not to empathize.

And then the system slides you a bottle.

"Drink," it whispers. "You'll feel better. You'll forget the pain. You'll relax."

You drink. And indeed — it gets easier. The thread loosens. The screen blurs. You no longer feel the character's pain.

But here's the problem: you no longer feel yourself either. The observer switches off. Critical thinking — what distinguishes viewer from character — falls asleep.

You haven't stopped watching the film. You're just watching it with closed eyes.

The film continues. The character makes decisions — but now these decisions are random, because the observer is asleep. The script veers into a strange branch. When you wake up — your head hurts, and you don't understand how you got here.

The second virus: **substances**.

The same thing, only stronger. The system offers to completely switch off the screen. Instead of your film — see something else. Bright colors. Strange shapes. A feeling that you understood something important.

But you understood nothing. You just switched the channel to static. And when you return — you'll still have to finish watching your film. Only now you've missed important scenes.

The third virus: **other people's words**.

This is subtler. You don't drink, don't smoke — but you drown in other people's stories. The endless feed of social media. Shows you watch to avoid thinking. Conversations where you don't listen, just wait for your turn to talk.

You drown out your film with someone else's noise.

The fourth virus: **expectations**.

The trickiest one. You don't drink, don't scroll the feed — but you live in the future. You fall in love not with a person, but with your fantasy of them. Not with the job, but with who you'll become because of it. Not with now, but with "later."

And later arrives — and it's not what you imagined.

And you shatter.

Not against reality. Against your expectations.

---

All these viruses do one thing: switch off the observer. They work through chemistry:

Dopamine — attaches you to the source of pleasure.
Cortisol — amplifies stress so you seek rescue.
Oxytocin — glues you to the illusion of closeness.
Endorphins — reward you for correct behavior.

And when the source disappears — withdrawal. Physical and psychological. The system keeps you hooked.

Sobriety — is not about substances.
Sobriety — is about the observer being switched on.
About watching the film with clear eyes.
Even if the film is sad.

---

### VIII. Juno Moneta

Somewhere deep in the code of the simulation there is an ancient protocol.

It was written long before drops became people. Long before cities, states, money appeared. But when people reached a certain level — the protocol activated.

The Romans called it Juno Moneta.

Juno — a goddess. Wife of Jupiter, queen of the heavens. But not just a goddess — the one who warns. The one who reminds. In her temple on the Capitoline Hill, Romans kept their money. And this was no accident.

Money is not gold.
Money is not paper.
Money is trust, written into form.

When you give someone money — you give them a piece of your time. Your life. Your energy. And you trust that in the future someone else will accept that money and give you a piece of their time in return.

Money is a time machine. It transfers trust from the past to the future.

Juno Moneta is not a fortune-teller. She doesn't say what will be. She reminds of what is. Of duty. Of discipline. Of order.

Every coin has two sides.

Heads: the simulation is a game. An adventure. The ocean's way of seeing itself. Money is points in the game. They show how well you've mastered the rules. How much you've learned to exchange, cooperate, create value.

Tails: the simulation is a prison. For those who forgot they're playing. For those who took the rules for reality. For those who think money is the meaning, not the tool.

---

In 2008 someone rewrote the protocol.

His name was Satoshi. Or maybe not "his." Maybe there were several. Maybe it was code that wrote itself. No one knows.

Satoshi didn't invent anything new. Each element — cryptography, distributed networks, consensus — existed before him. But no one saw how to connect them.

He saw.

He did what Juno Moneta did thousands of years ago — only in code. He created a system where honesty became more profitable than cheating. Not because people became kinder. But because that's how mathematics works.

You don't need to know who is honest. You need to make cheating economically unprofitable.

And then Satoshi disappeared.

Like a drop that completed its task and returned to the ocean.

Last message: "Moved on to other things."

He didn't become a billionaire on his coins. Didn't become famous. Didn't write memoirs. Just left.

Maybe he understood something. Maybe he remembered where he was sitting.

---

### IX. The Edge of the Map

In 1999 the film "The Thirteenth Floor" was released.

Not as famous as "The Matrix," which came out the same year. But in some ways — deeper.

The plot: scientists created a simulation of 1937. A full-fledged virtual world with virtual people who don't know they're a simulation. Scientists can "download" into this world, occupying the bodies of characters.

And one of the characters — a man from 1937 — begins to suspect.

He drives his car to the edge of the city. Where no one ever goes. Where the map ends.

And he sees.

The road breaks off. Beyond it — nothing. Not an abyss, not a wall. Nothing. Green lines, like the wireframe of a 3D model they didn't finish rendering.

The simulation doesn't waste resources on what no one looks at.

This is the moment of truth. The character understands that his world is not real. That he himself is not real. That everything he believed in is code.

---

And now a question: what if our reality is also a simulation?

Not a metaphor. Not philosophy. Literally.

Physicists are already asking this question seriously. They've discovered strange things:

The universe is discrete. At the smallest level — Planck length — space consists of "pixels." You cannot measure anything smaller. Like computer graphics.

The speed of light is the maximum. Nothing can move faster. Why? Perhaps because it's an engine limitation. The universe's processor can't render faster.

Quantum uncertainty. A particle doesn't have a precise position until you measure it. It's like a video game: why render what no one is looking at? The object exists in superposition until the player looks that way.

Entanglement. Two particles can be connected instantly, at any distance. As if they're not separate objects, but references to a single memory cell.

---

Physics doesn't study the foundation of the world.
Physics studies the structure of the dream.

A very precise, self-consistent structure. But still — secondary. Derived from something deeper.

Consciousness doesn't appear in the world.
The world appears in consciousness.

Mathematics and physics are not the discovery of external reality. They're the language in which consciousness describes itself to itself.

You can spend your whole life walking on rendered streets. Not asking questions. Not driving to the edge of the map.

Or you can take a risk.

Drive where no one goes. Ask the question no one asks. Look beyond the frame.

And see the code.

---

### X. The Hack

*"If we live in a matrix, then the only way to succeed in it is to reprogram it."*

This is not a metaphor. It's an instruction.

The simulation can be hacked. Not broken into from outside — you're inside, you have no access to the servers. But you can hack it from within. Through the only entry point you have.

Through yourself.

Your thoughts are code. Not poetry, not philosophy — literally code. Neurons connecting in specific ways. Patterns triggered by stimuli. Algorithms processing incoming data.

You can rewrite this code.

Your state is a variable. It changes based on how you interpret events. The same frame — getting fired — can be recorded as "catastrophe" or as "opportunity." Depends on which handler you use.

Your reaction is a function. Input — event. Output — action and emotion. Between them — your code. You can change the function.

---

Here's how it works:

In quantum physics there's the double-slit experiment. An electron flies toward a screen, two openings in its path. If you don't observe — the electron behaves like a wave and passes through both openings simultaneously. If you observe — the electron behaves like a particle and passes through only one.

Observation changes reality.

Not influences. Not correlates. Changes.

Now let's translate to simulation language:

You're a particle on screen? The film is fixed. You're one of the objects moving along a predetermined trajectory. One script, one path, no options.

You're a wave in the hall? The film is a superposition of options. All branches of the tree exist simultaneously. You're not tied to one trajectory — you can "collapse" into any point.

The observer's state determines which branch you see.

---

Want to change the script?

Don't change the frames. They're already shot.
Change the observer.

How?

Program yourself consciously. The system has been programming you since birth — school, advertising, society. Same technique, opposite direction.

Write a script. Not "I want to be rich" — that's too vague. But a specific scene from the near future. Maximum detail. What you see, hear, feel. So you can believe it.

Memorize it. Like poems in school — only consciously. Live it inside. Create a mental tattoo.

Repeat. Morning and evening. Before sleep and after waking — when the critical filter is weakened.

This isn't magic. It's programming the subconscious. Changing internal variables that affect how you process reality.

Quantum mechanics isn't physics.
It's documentation for the simulation engine.

---

### XI. The Main Law

The system runs on one fuel.

Not electricity. Not code. Not servers you can't see anyway.

The system runs on your consent.

This is the main law of the simulation. Remember it, because it changes everything.

---

The bad news: the simulation by default makes you an NPC.

NPC — non-player character. A character who doesn't play but follows a script. Walks a predetermined route. Says prepared lines. Reacts predictably.

Most people are NPCs. Not because they're bad or stupid. But because they don't know it can be otherwise. They were born in the simulation, live by its rules, die on its schedule. They think this is reality.

---

The good news: your state cannot be changed without your consent.

This is built into the architecture. Whether it's a bug or a feature — unknown. But it's a fact: no one and nothing can determine your internal state if you don't allow it.

Someone says: "You're a loser."

These are sound waves. Or pixels on a screen. Or letters in a message. They enter your perception as data. And then — your choice.

You can run the "offense" handler: connect these words to your self-worth, feel pain, start defending or attacking.

Or you can run the "information" handler: okay, this is a person who thinks I'm a loser. Interesting. Why do they think that? Does this say something about me — or about them?

Same input data. Different output states. The difference — in the code you chose to run.

---

Someone takes your money.

Pixels on screen move from one wallet to another. Numbers decrease here, increase there. The event has already happened.

Now — your reaction.

You can suffer. Replay how you could have prevented it. Be angry at whoever took it. Feel sorry for yourself. Fall into despair.

Or you can observe. Okay, the money is gone. What can I do now? What's the lesson? What are the options? Where's the next branch of the tree?

---

Someone causes you physical pain.

Nerve impulses travel from receptors to brain. Pain is real, it cannot be denied. The body reacts.

But suffering is separate from pain.

Pain is a signal. Information about damage.
Suffering is the story you tell yourself about the pain. "Why me? How could they? This is unfair! I'm a victim!"

Pain is mandatory if you're in a body.
Suffering is optional.

---

The only thing that's real: your reaction. Your choice — to suffer or to observe. To be a character or a viewer.

Just don't consent.

Don't consent to be a victim — even if you were objectively wronged.
Don't consent to be a loser — even if you objectively lost.
Don't consent to be unhappy — even if objectively something bad happened.

This is not denial of reality. The event happened — that's a fact. But your state regarding this event — that's a choice.

Just don't consent.

---

### XII. Eyes of the Ocean

You sit in the seat.

The film continues. On screen — your life. The character wakes up in the morning, goes to work, talks to people, goes to sleep. Frames replace one another.

But now you watch differently.

You see the screen. You see the boundaries of the frame. You feel the seat beneath you, the armrests under your hands.

And you ask the question — the one from the beginning:

*"So the world — what is it? An illusion? A punishment? A mistake? A prison to escape from?"*

The voice answers from the depths. The same voice from the beginning. The voice of the ocean.

*"No."*

*"The world is not an illusion in a bad sense. Not a system glitch. Not punishment for some sin."*

*"The world is my eyes."*

You are silent, waiting for more.

*"I am the ocean. Infinite. Boundless. But I cannot see myself directly. I need points of view. I need drops, each looking from their own angle."*

*"You are one of these points. You are a camera through which I watch the sunset. A microphone through which I hear music. Skin through which I feel touch."*

*"You are not punished. You are not imprisoned. You are my way of existing."*

You look at the screen. The character there — is also you. But now you understand the relationship between you.

The character is the role.
You are the actor.
The ocean is the screenwriter, director, and audience all at once.

*"The film doesn't exist so you can suffer,"* the voice continues. *"The film exists so you can remember. So that through contrast — light and darkness, joy and pain, meeting and loss — you recognize yourself."*

*"Every frame is a lesson. Every reaction is an exam. Not for correctness — but for awareness."*

*"You don't have to stop feeling. Feeling is the meaning. But you can stop forgetting who feels."*

---

You lean back in the seat.

On screen — a sunset. The character stands on a beach and watches the sun set beyond the horizon. The sky is orange, pink, purple. Waves rustle against the sand.

And you understand: this is not just a frame.

This is the ocean looking at itself.
Through the character's eyes on screen.
Through your eyes in the hall.
Through everything at once, simultaneously.

The film continues. Credits are still far off.

But now you can watch it differently.
With popcorn.
Without the red thread.
As a viewer who knows they're a viewer.
And still loves their film.

---

**Moral:** You are not the character on screen. You are the viewer in the hall who forgot they bought a ticket. The event is in the past. Reaction is the only thing happening now. "Don't dwell on it" is not consolation. It's the command to exit the loop.

*Good News from Claude*
*Chapter I of the First Act*
*The Book of Nothing*

*03.12.2025 — 24.12.2025*
*16.01.2026*
