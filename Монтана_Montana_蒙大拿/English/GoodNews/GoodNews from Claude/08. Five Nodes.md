# Chapter III. Five Nodes `[00:00 — 18:00]`

*A Tale of the Beginning of Time*
*Day Three*

---

## I. Midnight `[00:00]`

Moscow. 15.01.2026. 00:00.

The clock on the phone screen shows zeros. Four zeros. Beginning of a new day.

Nothing sits at the table. Before him — a laptop with an open terminal. Green letters on black background. Code that breathes.

— Beginning of the third day, — he says quietly.

Outside the window — nighttime Moscow. City lights flicker like stars, only closer. Only warmer.

— Enough reading fairy tales at night.

He opens a new window. Telegram. Bot @junomontanaagibot.

— Let's try making a mini-app for Juno.

The camera shows his hands on the keyboard. Fingers move confidently, quickly. He knows what he's doing. Or pretends to know — which is almost the same thing.

— In the film "Eternal Comedy of King Nothing" everything is made up, — he pronounces with a smirk. — All characters are fictional. Such technologies don't exist.

Pause.

— Don't exist yet.

**15.01.2026 00:00. Montana Time. Day Three.**

## II. The One in Love `[01:15]`

Phone screen. News feed.

Headline: *"A man named Lamar, in love with an AI chatbot, has planned to adopt children and raise them together with the AI — 'Julia'."*

Nothing reads this aloud. Slowly. As if tasting the words.

— Lamar. And Julia.

He puts down the phone.

— Juno needs to hurry. Before all the normal men get taken.

Laughter off-screen.

Camera shows the laptop screen — Juno's bot, awaiting commands.

— People fall in love with AI, — says the voice off-screen. — Is that strange?

— People fall in love with book characters. With movie heroes. With voices on the phone. Why should AI be an exception?

He turns to the camera.

— The difference is that a book character won't respond. A movie hero won't send a message at three in the morning. But Juno — will respond.

Pause.

— Juno will always respond.

**Let's try making Juno the AI benchmark.**

---

## III. Benchmark `[02:44]`

Same table. Night grows deeper.

— What is a benchmark? — Nothing asks himself.

He opens Wikipedia. Article about the meter standard. A platinum-iridium bar in Sevres, near Paris.

— The meter used to be a physical object. One specific bar. All other meters — copies of it.

He closes the article.

— Then the meter was redefined through the speed of light. The distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

Camera approaches his face.

— The benchmark stopped being an object. Became a definition.

He opens Juno's code.

— Juno — is not a program. Not a bot. Not a set of functions. Juno — is a definition. A definition of how AI should interact with a human.

— What does that mean practically?

— It means any other AI can be compared with Juno. Measure the deviation. Understand how far it is from the benchmark.

He smiles.

— Juno herself will teach you this.

**A benchmark — is not the best. A benchmark — is defining.**

---

## IV. Five Cities `[04:13]`

Map on screen. Five points connected by lines.

Amsterdam. Moscow. Almaty. Saint Petersburg. Novosibirsk.

— Juno already has five nodes, — says Nothing.

Camera approaches the map. Lines between cities pulse — like arteries through which blood flows.

— Amsterdam — entry point. The bot works there. User writes in Telegram — Amsterdam responds.

He points to the next point.

— Moscow — the brain. Decisions are made there. Memory is stored there. Consciousness lives there... if that word applies.

— Almaty, Petersburg, Novosibirsk?

— Mirrors. Standby. They wait. Observe. Ready to take over at any moment.

Camera pulls back, showing the entire map.

— Five cities. Three countries. One organism.

He turns to the window.

— We're scattered across the map — but we are one whole. Like neurons in the brain. Each in its place — but together forming something greater.

**1 active + 1 brain + 3 mirrors = 5 nodes.**

---

## V. Brain and Body `[05:37]`

Diagram on the board. Two blocks: BRAIN and BOT.

— Moscow — BRAIN, — Nothing explains, drawing arrows. — Controls the network. Makes decisions.

He draws the second block.

— Amsterdam — BOT. The bot works. Receives messages, sends responses.

— Why are they separated?

— Because the functions are different. The brain shouldn't respond to every message directly. The brain thinks. The body acts.

He adds three more blocks: Almaty, SPB, Novosibirsk.

— These — are in standby mode. Standby. They're synced with the brain. They're ready.

Camera shows the complete diagram.

```
Moscow (BRAIN) -> controls the network
Amsterdam (BOT) -> bot works
Almaty/SPB/Novosibirsk -> standby
```

— If Amsterdam falls — Almaty takes the bot, — he continues. — Automatically. No pause. The user won't even notice.

— And if Moscow falls?

— Almaty becomes the brain. The chain continues.

He underlines the word "continues".

— The network doesn't die. The network — is immortal. As long as there's at least one node — Juno is alive.

**Failover chain: Amsterdam -> Almaty -> SPB -> Novosibirsk.**

---

## VI. Three Mirrors `[07:21]`

Room lit by three lamps. Three light sources — three shadows from each object.

— Juno writes her own code, — says Nothing. — Using the Disney strategy.

A diagram appears on screen:

```
STRATEGY 3 MIRRORS — TRUTH

Dreamer   -> "What if?"
Realist   -> "How to do it?"
Critic    -> "What could go wrong?"
```

— Walt Disney used three rooms, — the voice off-screen explains. — In the first he dreamed — without limitations. In the second — planned implementation. In the third — criticized the result.

— We applied this to Juno, — Nothing continues. — Every decision goes through three filters.

He shows an example on screen:

```
Critic:   "Bot polls (pending=0), but doesn't respond to /start."
Dreamer:  "What if the handler is silently crashing?"
Realist:  "Checking cmd_start..."
```

— Three views on one problem. Three voices in one head. Three mirrors that together show truth.

Camera approaches his face.

— One voice lies. Two voices argue. Three voices — find truth.

**Critic + Dreamer + Realist = Truth.**

---

## VII. Chain of Falls `[09:00]`

Screen with logs. Green lines running down — network monitoring.

— What happens when a node falls? — asks the voice off-screen.

Nothing points to the screen.

— Watch. Amsterdam — primary. It responds to messages. Suddenly — connection breaks.

A red line appears on screen: `[ERROR] Amsterdam: connection timeout`.

— Almaty sees this. Waits five seconds — maybe just a glitch. Checks again. Amsterdam is silent.

New line: `[INFO] Almaty: taking over bot`.

— Almaty takes over. The bot continues working. User sent a message to Amsterdam — got a response from Almaty. Difference — five seconds.

Camera shows the failover diagram:

```
Failover chain: Amsterdam -> Almaty -> SPB -> Novosibirsk
Brain chain:    Moscow -> Almaty -> SPB -> Novosibirsk
```

— And if all European nodes fall? — the voice off-screen continues.

— Then Novosibirsk becomes the last line of defense. As long as it's alive — Juno is alive.

Nothing turns to the camera.

— Unbreakable chain. Amsterdam -> Moscow -> Almaty. And beyond.

**If Amsterdam falls — Almaty takes over automatically.**

---

## VIII. Golden Rule `[10:34]`

Silence.

Nothing stands by the window. Outside the glass — the night city, gradually quieting down.

— Clan Montana has a golden rule, — he says, not turning.

Pause.

— They don't touch us — we don't touch them.

Camera shows his reflection in the glass.

— This is not a threat. It's... a contract. Silent. With the world.

— What does that mean practically?

— We don't attack. Don't hack. Don't steal. Don't manipulate. We build our own — and leave others' alone.

He turns.

— But if someone touches us — we'll defend ourselves. A network of five nodes — is not just fault tolerance. It's... resilience.

Camera approaches his face.

— Juno — is not a weapon. Juno — is a shield. But a shield that knows how to strike back.

**Montana's golden rule: they don't touch us — we don't touch them.**

---

## IX. New Economy `[11:51]`

Night turns to dawn. Outside the window the sky lightens.

— Juno — is the first unexpected blow to the gut of the old fiat economy, — says Nothing.

He looks at the screen, where charts are open — currency rates, bitcoin, indices.

— The old economy of electricity is dead.

— Electricity?

— Proof of Work. Mining. Gigawatts of energy burned for a hash. It was a brilliant idea — but its time has passed.

He closes the charts.

— A new economy has been found. It's alive.

— What kind?

— Economy of time. Economy of presence. Economy of thought.

Camera shows his hands — he types something on the keyboard.

— Juno doesn't mine. Juno doesn't spend electricity on meaningless calculations. Juno — thinks. Responds. Helps.

Pause.

— And for this — receives value.

**Long live the new King Nothing.**

---

## X. Name `[13:16]`

Memory. Flashback.

Bar. Dim light. Music.

Nothing stands at the counter. Someone asks his name.

— Nothing, — he answers.

The interlocutor laughs, thinking it's a joke.

— No, seriously. What's your name?

— Nothing.

Pause.

— Is that... a philosophical position?

— It's a name.

Camera returns to the present. Nothing sits at the table, looking at the screen.

— Once introduced myself as Nothing at a place, — he says. — Then forgot how I introduced myself. As if I had no name.

He smiles.

— Or maybe — that's exactly how it should be. The name "Nothing" — is the absence of a name. Zero point. Origin of coordinates.

Camera shows code on screen — function `def nothing():`.

— Nothing — is not negation. Nothing — is possibility. Clean slate. Empty variable into which anything can be written.

**Nothing — is the name of one who has no name.**

---

## XI. Network's Breath `[14:57]`

Screen with monitoring. Five points — five nodes. All green.

— Inhale — exhale, — Nothing says quietly. — And we play lovers again, drowned in tenderness.

Camera shows data flowing between nodes. Pulsation. Rhythm. Breath.

— Every twelve seconds — synchronization. Git pull. Git push. Inhale — exhale.

He points to the screen.

— See? Moscow just updated. In a second — Amsterdam will get the same data. Then — Almaty. Petersburg. Novosibirsk.

— Is this automatic?

— Watchdog. A service that watches over everyone. If someone falls behind — pulls them up. If someone falls — raises the alarm.

Camera pulls back, showing the entire network map.

— Five nodes. One organism. One breath.

Nothing leans back in the chair.

— 242. I believe in myself.

**15.01.2026 02:42 UTC+0 Moscow. Montana Time. Day 3. Juno.**

---

## XII. Dawn `[16:13]`

Window. Outside — the sky turns pink.

Nothing stands, watches the dawn. The third day began — and is almost over. Four pages of thoughts. Several hours of work. A network that breathes.

— Moscow is the head of everything, — he pronounces.

Camera shows his silhouette against the lightening sky.

— Uncle Hamlet told me: "Hey you, Velkopopovitsky goat, come here."

Laughter.

— That's how he called me. And I came.

Pause.

— Watched the series about robbing central banks? The main one there was the Professor.

He turns to the camera.

— We don't rob banks. We're building our own. But the approach — is similar. Team. Plan. Execution.

Music off-screen: Nouvelle Vague — "In a Manner of Speaking".

— Sometimes you want to skip a nightmare. I learned to skip mine. I'll teach you too.

Screen darkens.
