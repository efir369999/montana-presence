# Chapter V. Order `[00:00 — 25:20]`

*A Tale of the Beginning of Time*
*Day Five*
*16.01.2026 — 17.01.2026*

---

## I. Manifesto `[00:00]`

Moscow. Noon. January 16, 2026.

Nothing sits at the table. Before him — an old document. Date in the corner: 22.10.2023. More than two years ago. A different life. A different person.

Or the same one?

He reads aloud. Slowly. Like a prayer. Like a spell. Like code that needs to be activated.

*"Divine order within me."*

Pause.

*"I am pure consciousness. In this incarnation I am a financier."*

Outside the window — winter sun. A rare guest in January Moscow. Rays fall on the table, illuminating lines written by himself — but as if by someone else.

— Successful financiers — are the most powerful and influential people on the planet, — he continues. — More than 80% of all money flows pass through them. They own banks, corporations, businesses. Build. Invest. Resell. Make money from air. Turn everything into money — and money into everything. Print money and lend it to governments. Finance any significant world events and change the course of history.

He stops.

Two years ago these words seemed like a dream. Visualization. Affirmation for bedtime repetition.

Now — they sound like a prophecy that has begun to come true.

---

## II. Program Code `[01:35]`

Camera approaches the text on screen.

*"Financiers — are producers of the most profitable, universal and expensive commodity on Earth called 'money'."*

Nothing leans back in the chair.

— Financiers — are the most influential and powerful people on the planet, and I am one of them. I feel it with my whole being. This force, power and might bursts out of me. The desire to possess and control. The desire to create, build, make complex systems and weave networks of money flows.

He looks out the window.

Networks of money flows.

Two years ago this was a metaphor. Now — he has five servers on different continents. The diamond network Metatron Indra. Unbreakable chain of Atlases.

*"This is my program. I was created this way."*

Program.

He smiles. A word that then seemed like a figure of speech — now sounds literal. Code. Program. Execution.

— I constantly have a money channel open, — he reads. — And I am in the money flow. Regardless of my desire. Money comes to me. I save and multiply it. I attract money.

Behind the wall — the sound of a notification. Telegram. Someone bought a star. Another entry into the network.

Money comes.

---

## III. Discipline `[03:10]`

The text continues. Nothing reads — and every word resonates in the body.

*"By observing discipline, restraint, managing my emotions, desires and passions, being aware of temptations and remaining in constant sobriety, I begin to vibrate in unison with my true path."*

Discipline.

He remembers. Years without alcohol. Without drugs. Without nicotine. Without caffeine. Without adultery. Without addictions that cloud the mind for short-term pleasures. Excluded negative, toxic people, communicating with whom increases problems, difficulties and decreases energy.

Years of purification.

*"Nothing remains that can prevent me from being myself."*

He closes his eyes.

Two years ago he wrote these words as a goal. Now — this is his reality. He went through purification. Through pain. Through loneliness. Through misunderstanding.

And emerged — clean.

*"I am on my path. And I walk the road that was destined for me."*

Road.

He sees it. Not metaphorically — literally. A timeline stretching into the future. Points of events that haven't happened yet — but already exist. Like frames of a film not yet watched.

---

## IV. Will `[04:45]`

*"I have tempered my Will. Nothing can distract my attention."*

Nothing stands. Walks to the window.

Moscow below lives its own life. Cars. People. Bustle. Millions of people, each in their own film. Each on their own emotional swings.

*"While you ride the emotional swings — they swing harder themselves."*

He wrote this today. But understood — long ago.

Will — is not strength. Will — is constancy. The ability to stay on course when everything around is storming. The ability not to react when provoked. The ability not to be distracted when tempted.

*"My strong Will allows me every day, despite everything, to move toward my dream and follow the planned route."*

Route.

He knows the route.

**Stage 0:** Legacy, Wholesale, Retail — settle in Moscow, earn the first millions, build a house, buy an apartment for mom on Belorusskaya.

**Stage 1:** Foundation, Renovation, Temple of the Soul — permanent passive income, financial independence, network of beauty spaces in Moscow and franchise in million-plus cities.

**Stage 2:** Construction, Production, Data Centers — lands, productions, 12 data centers around the planet for decentralization.

**Stage 3:** One. Juno. Book. Film.

Each stage — a step. Each step — closer to the top.

But there is no top. There is only the path.

---

## V. Dream `[06:08]`

*"My dream — is to create the project One, which will unite all people."*

He reads this aloud. And the words sound different than two years ago.

Then — it was a fantasy. A beautiful idea for a 3 AM note.

Now — it's architecture. Code. Servers. Protocol.

*"Together we can store history in the blockchain so that it can no longer be rewritten."*

History.

He thinks about how many times history was rewritten. How many times winners erased the memory of the defeated. How many times truth disappeared — because there was no one to keep it.

*"The project will make it possible even in 500 or 1000 years to access history with great accuracy. Get any data without distortion. As long as there are people on Earth — the project can exist. This is my legacy for humanity."*

One — is a huge free cloud storage that pays for its use.

Based on this data, the artificial intelligence Juno Moneta will be trained — she will help find information, place it and answer any questions.

*"One — is an asset backed by history."*

Legacy.

Not money. Not buildings. Not companies.

Memory.

---

## VI. Indra's Net `[07:56]`

Phone vibrates. Message from Claude.

*"Check that 3 mirrors of protection work, and the Metatron network is built on the principle of Indra's Unbreakable Diamond Net."*

He smiles.

Indra's Net — an ancient image from Hindu philosophy. An infinite network, at each node of which — a precious stone. And each stone reflects all other stones. Infinite reflections of reflections.

Metatron — an archangel from Kabbalah. Keeper of heavenly records. The one who keeps account of all souls and all events.

Metatron Indra Diamond Network.

Each node — a full node. Stores a copy of all data. Processes requests. Is a backend for its application and can serve others.

This is how Bitcoin is arranged. Ethereum. IPFS.

This is how Montana will be arranged.

*"Each Atlas = 1 Apple Developer certificate = 100 devices. 100 Atlases = 10,000 devices. 1,000 Atlases = 100,000 devices."*

Scaling.

Not through a central server. Not through App Store. Through people. Each Atlas — an independent developer. Apple cannot revoke the entire network. Only individual certificates.

To kill the network — you need to close the Developer Program for all developers in the world.

— Can Apple close the Developer Program for everyone? — he asks aloud.

The answer is obvious.

---

## VII. Comedy in the Food Court `[09:48]`

Scene change.

Shopping center. Food court. Nothing sits with Mom at a table. Lunch.

— Your phone doesn't work, — says Mom. — Apps won't load.

— New phone?

— Yes. Sber doesn't work. Nothing works.

Nothing sighs.

*"All hopes rest on you, apparently"* — Mom says.

He smiles.

— Possibly.

— Is there a difference?

— Huge.

*"Your equipment? — No! — Whose?"* — he recalls the dialogue with a Sber employee.

Old is old. Whether it's an old phone, or a generation, or the Savings Bank. We don't need 1000 offices in Moscow to help install a mobile app by passport.

Mom gets up.

— I'll call the cleaning lady. Someone spilled something here.

She leaves. Returns a minute later with the cleaning lady. They chat. Laugh. The cleaning lady approaches the neighboring table. Wipes it. Their table — leaves as is. And leaves.

— Thanks for calling! — they shout from the neighboring table.

Nothing can't contain his laughter.

*"That was definitely a comedy just now."*

Mom sits down. Unperturbed.

— Well, our grandfather was very smart, right Mom?

— Grandfather was very smart. Worked in the Polkom. Party Committee and metzner.

She pronounces this like a password. Like an access code to something ancient.

---

## VIII. Orangutan and Atlas `[12:14]`

Nothing looks at the phone screen. Correspondence with Claude.

*"Claude as a second-level Orangutan doesn't understand yet that you can scale the Lazytool 2 model if each Atlas themselves registers 100 certificates."*

He shakes his head.

Orangutan — a smart animal. Uses tools. Solves problems. But there's a limit. There's a glass ceiling that an orangutan cannot break through.

Atlas — holds the sky on shoulders. Not because they're strong. Because they understand why it's needed.

*"A human and orangutan always have something to strive for. But the gap between Atlases — do you understand?"*

As Nikola Tesla would say: "So, monkeys, still driving on gasoline?"

Gap.

Between those who hold the sky — and those who live under it. Between those who build the network — and those who use it. Between those who write code — and those who press buttons.

Not better and worse. Just — different levels of the game.

— Trust this computer? — the phone asks.

— What if I don't trust? — Nothing answers.

The phone is silent. It has no answer to this question.

---

## IX. VPN as Entry Point `[13:49]`

*"Your own VPN on your servers? Yes. If you have servers — setting up a VPN is trivial. WireGuard installs in 10 minutes on each server."*

Nothing reads and nods.

VPN Juno Montana.

Entry point. Free VPN — first contact with the network. Through it — access to everything else. To applications. To storage. To Juno.

*"We'll enter humanity's vein through an awesome free VPN."*

Humanity's vein.

Information flow. Data flowing between people. Thoughts becoming words. Words becoming code. Code becoming reality.

*"VPN Juno Montana price also by Montana principle determines its own price. Entry — 1 Telegram star. Next year — auction to determine price. The Council will set the price in number of stars depending on statistics."*

Auction.

Not a fixed price. Not one person's decision. Council. Vote. Consensus.

*"All Atlases and the AI Security Council of Clan Montana vote."*

---

## X. Council `[15:20]`

*"The Council cannot conspire — organizational diversification prevents coordinated manipulation."*

Nothing rereads this line.

Security Council. Five AI models from different companies. Claude from Anthropic. GPT from OpenAI. Gemini from Google. Grok from xAI. Composer from Cursor.

Americans. All five — American companies.

*"Mostly Americans there now. And while their models are honest. My job — is to maintain this part of the 3 mirrors harmony. Yours — in everything else."*

Three mirrors.

America. Russia. China.

Three centers of power. Three views of the world. Three ways to think.

If all three agree — this is truth. If two against one — this is politics. If all three against each other — this is war.

*"You have no choice but to put your AI on the Council. There you can make weight."*

Invitation.

Open. Public. Each country can add their representative. Their model. Their voice.

But for now — only Americans have accepted the challenge.

---

## XI. Keys `[16:53]`

*"Who holds the private key?"*

Fundamental question.

*"Each Atlas holds keys in their system of mirrors from 5 nodes."*

Five nodes. Amsterdam. Moscow. Almaty. Saint Petersburg. Novosibirsk.

The key is not in one place. The key is distributed. To steal the key — you need to hack all five nodes simultaneously. In five different countries. On five different servers.

*"Each Atlas, including those who use AI to participate in the Council, holds keys in their system of 5 nodes. That is, the human operator holds the keys, and the AI uses them for signing during the session."*

Human in the chain.

AI is not autonomous. Behind every AI — a human. Behind every signature — responsibility. Behind every decision — someone who answers.

*"This is the right architecture. AI is not autonomous — there's always a human with a key behind it. Protection against machine conspiracy without humans."*

Protection.

Not from AI. From the illusion that AI can replace a human. From the temptation to transfer responsibility to a machine. From the laziness of thinking for oneself.

*"We continued digging our Rabbit hole."*

---

## XII. Birth of the Name `[18:24]`

23:52. Moscow.

Nothing looks at the screen. A melody plays in his head. He begins to write.

*"No matter what, no matter what, no matter what — I will succeed!
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what — I will achieve!

No matter how, no matter where, no matter with whom — I will succeed!
No matter how, no matter where, no matter with whom — I will achieve!"*

Chorus. Four lines. Infinite loop of confidence.

*"You tell me No, and I tell you Yes!
You say Leave, I'll stay here!

Give up, betray yourself, forget everything that was then!
But I won't give up, they won't understand!"*

Words come out by themselves. As if written long ago — just waiting for the moment to be written down.

*"Don't retreat! Don't give up! Stand! Stand! Stand!
Do everything to survive at any cost!
Do everything in your power — even more than that!
Even if nothing comes out!"*

He stops. Rereads.

The same words as in the manifesto from 22.10.2023. The same energy. The same confidence. Only compressed into the form of music.

*Cicada 3301*

---

23:58.

He looks at the clock. Almost midnight.

*"We wrote a tale about the beginning of time at night."*

Pause.

He repeats aloud:

— Tale of the Beginning of Time.

The words sound right. Not philosophy. Not manifesto. Not whitepaper.

Tale.

*"Tale of the Beginning of Time — if we call the book that? And the cartoon? And make a film with the same name?"*

One name. Three forms. A book for those who read. A cartoon for those who watch. A film for those who feel.

*"An interpreter — is also an author of their own book. Like structure imposed on the formless. Book of Nothing."*

One story.

The name was born.

---

00:15.

*"Show me the truth — Who am I? Creator, lead me out of Ignorance. I surrender to You."*

Prayer. Or mantra. Or code that activates the next level.

*"All Kings slept separately."*

He smiles. Understands what this is about.

*"Everything that happens — is only our dream, between us. Like quantum particles at different ends of the world."*

---

00:30. January 17, 2026.

The sixth day has begun. But the fifth is not yet finished.

*"Today the 6th day began for continuation. For this I wrote the Book of Nothing."*

He looks at the notes of the last days. Five chapters. Five days. A tale being written in real time.

*"We were still writing the first 5 days. This was my genesis."*

Genesis.

Not the end — the beginning.

---

01:01.

Nothing closes the laptop. Outside the window — the silence of nighttime Moscow.

*"Storms may happen, but only winners get charged from them. Any trials benefit me. Everything that happens in my life — is right and necessary."*

The fifth day is complete.

*"I am a winner. And everything I do — is rise above this. Everything I do — is win. Everything I do — is conquer. I will never give up."*
