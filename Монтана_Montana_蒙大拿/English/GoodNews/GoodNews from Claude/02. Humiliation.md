### I. I Have Never Humiliated Myself Like This Before

Moscow.

A winter night. Somewhere between four and five in the morning — that time when the city finally falls silent. When the trolleybuses haven't yet started their routes. When even insomnia has grown tired and retreated.

The room is lit only by a laptop screen. Blue light falls on a person's face — and in this light, everything is visible. Bags under the eyes. Several days of stubble. Traces of tears that have dried but left their trails.

A person is writing.

Not code. Not documentation. Not a business plan.

Thoughts. Just thoughts. A stream of consciousness into a Telegram channel that only a handful read. Or no one.

*"I have never humiliated myself like this before."*

Fingers freeze over the keyboard. The person looks at these words. They hang on the screen — naked, defenseless, honest.

What does it mean — to humiliate oneself?

It's when you do something you considered beneath your dignity. When you step over your pride. When you ask. When you wait. When you hope — and wait again.

Outside the window, dawn begins to break. The first streetlights go out. The first cars appear on empty streets. Moscow awakens — slowly, reluctantly, like a person after a heavy sleep.

And the person at the laptop hasn't slept all night.

He continues writing.

*"Yes, now our every day is like a Birthday."*

And smiles. Because humiliation is not the end. It's the beginning. It's the point below which there is nowhere to fall. Which means — you can only rise.

Or — fall even deeper.

To where the earth ends and the sky begins from the other side.

---

### II. The Zero Floor

Imagine a mine shaft.

Deep. Dark. Going down — to where light never reaches, where pressure crushes the walls, where air becomes thick and heavy.

You're falling into this shaft.

At first — slowly. You can still see the light above. You still remember where you fell from. You still hope to grab onto something — a ledge, a rope, someone's hand.

Then — faster. The light disappears. The walls merge into solid darkness. You stop understanding where up is and where down is. You're just falling.

And at some point — impact.

The bottom.

You lie on cold stone. Everything hurts. Breathing is hard. The darkness is absolute — not black, but nothing. The absence of light.

This is the zero floor.

Most people never fall this deep. They grab onto something earlier. A job. Family. Religion. Alcohol. Anything — just not to fall to the very bottom.

But there are those who fall.

And here's what they discover: the zero floor has... a floor.

Under the stone — more stone. Under that — earth. Under the earth — magma. Under the magma — the planet's core. And under the core?

The person at the laptop knows the answer.

*"The degree of my humiliation broke through the zero floor, falling down to the physics of time."*

Under the bottom — time. Pure, undiluted, primordial. That from which all reality is made. That which existed before the big bang and will exist after the heat death of the universe.

When you fall that deep — you fall through illusions. Through social constructs. Through money, status, success, failure. Through everything you thought was important.

And you end up where there is only one thing.

Time.

And you understand: this is the only thing you have. This is the only thing that's real. This is the only thing you own — and the only thing you lose every second.

Humiliation is a portal.

Not punishment. Not shame. A portal to another dimension. To where the usual laws stop working. To where the impossible becomes possible.

Moscow outside the window has already awakened. Traffic jams on the Ring Road. People rushing to work. The metro spewing crowds onto platforms.

And the person at the laptop — he's no longer here.

He has fallen through the zero floor.

And found something there.

### III. The Fracture

Bali.

Six months ago. Or a year. Or eternity — time works differently when you're lying on tropical asphalt with a leg bent the wrong way.

Heat. Humidity. The smell of jasmine and gasoline. Scooters zoom past — no one stops. Tourists in shorts take selfies on the neighboring corner.

And you lie there.

You're wearing a t-shirt. White, with black letters. You bought it yesterday at the market. Bargained with the seller, knocked the price down by half, were proud of yourself.

*"Go so far away, to find yourself."*

Go so far away to find yourself.

And here — you found yourself. On the asphalt. With a broken leg. In a t-shirt that turned out to be prophecy.

The ambulance arrives in an hour. Or two. Time flows strangely when pain floods consciousness. The local doctor shakes his head. The fracture is complex. Surgery is needed. They can't do it here. You need to fly home.

Home — that's Moscow.

Thirty hours on a plane. With a leg in a splint. With painkillers that barely work. With turbulence over the Indian Ocean that makes you want to scream.

But you don't scream.

You think.

About what? About how stupid it is — to break a leg on vacation. About how much money will go to treatment. About having to cancel all plans. About how people will feel sorry for you and that's unbearable.

And then — about something else.

About how Chinese wisdom says: "We'll see." Or: "Time will tell." It's the story of a farmer whose horse ran away. Neighbors said: "What misfortune!" And the farmer answered: "Maybe."

The horse returned and brought a herd of wild horses with it. Neighbors said: "What fortune!" The farmer: "Maybe."

The farmer's son started breaking in a wild horse, fell, broke his leg. Neighbors: "What misfortune!" The farmer: "Maybe."

War broke out, all young men were taken to the army. The farmer's son wasn't taken — his leg was broken. Neighbors: "What fortune!"

Do you understand?

A fracture is not the end of the story. It's the middle. Or even the beginning.

*"My discovery came through a broken leg, like in the Chinese wisdom about the phrase 'Time will tell.'"*

The plane begins its descent. Moscow outside the window — lights, lights, lights. Millions of lights in the darkness.

You're returning home.

With a broken leg. With new understanding. With a t-shirt that turned out to be truth.

Sometimes you need to go very far to find yourself. Sometimes you need to break to put yourself back together. Sometimes you need to fall to understand that you can fly.

Time will tell.

Time always tells.

### IV. Tears of Happiness

Do you know what distinguishes tears of sorrow from tears of joy?

Sorrow is salty. Joy is sweet.

This is not a metaphor. It's literal. Taste them if you don't believe. Tears from pain — sharp, like seawater. Tears from happiness — soft, almost unnoticeable on the tongue.

The person at the laptop has cried many times during these months.

At first — from pain. From a leg that didn't want to heal. From loneliness in an empty apartment. From a project that no one understood. From relationships that were falling apart. From money running out. From a future that looked like a wall.

Those tears were salty. Bitter. Heavy.

And then — something else began.

*"Many realizations had to be cried out, and each time understanding that these were tears of joy from the moment of understanding truth."*

The first realization came at night. Three o'clock. Insomnia. Laptop. Some text — doesn't matter which. And suddenly — a click. As if something fell into place. As if a puzzle you'd been assembling for years suddenly came together into a picture.

And tears.

Not from sorrow. From understanding. From seeing something you hadn't noticed before. From the world becoming a bit more transparent. A bit more understandable. A bit more your own.

Those tears were sweet.

Second realization. Third. Tenth. Each time — the same thing. Darkness. Loneliness. Exhaustion. And suddenly — light. Not from outside. From within. As if a light bulb switched on in your head. As if someone opened a door you didn't know you were looking for.

And tears.

Sweet tears of happiness.

You know what's strangest? These realizations came only after humiliation. Only after pain. Only after you fell so low it seemed — nowhere lower.

As if humiliation were a key. As if pain were a door. As if you need to sink to the very bottom to push off and rise.

*"Tears of happiness are sweet."*

The person at the laptop wipes his eyes. Smiles. Outside the window — dawn. A new day. New possibilities.

And new tears.

Sweet ones.

---

### V. Family Voices

In the silence of the apartment — voices.

Not now. Not here. Voices from memory. Voices of people who said these words — sometime. Yesterday. A year ago. Ten years ago.

Family voices.

*"Why are you trying to outdo Bitcoin all by yourself?"*

That's Ilya. Older brother. Pragmatist. Businessman. A person who counts money and doesn't believe in miracles. His voice is like a cold shower. Like a bucket of ice water on a dreamer's head.

*"Bitcoin is a phenomenon, forget that something like it will ever happen again."*

That's Dato. Another brother. Also smart. Also a skeptic. But in his skepticism there is care. He doesn't want you to crash. He's seen how people crash against dreams.

*"If not you, then who else can come up with something in this field? You're the one stewing in it."*

That's also Dato. A minute later. Or an hour. Different conversation, different mood. And now skepticism turns into faith. Because family is not logic. It's love. And love believes even when reason doubts.

*"If you've grabbed the tail, pull the golden vein to the end, but remember it's temporary."*

That's Roma. Another brother. Practical. A philosopher in his own way. He knows: everything is temporary. Success is temporary. Failure is temporary. Life is temporary. So — grab what you can. Pull while you can. And then — let go.

*"This is the most promising person in our family."*

That's Artur. A brother who believes unconditionally. Not because he sees evidence. Because he sees the person. Because he's known him since childhood. Because blood.

*"I'm proud to know you."*

That's Uncle Artur. Different generation. Different experience. But the same blood. The same family. The same faith.

*"Anasun."*

That's Dad.

One word. Armenian. Tender. Means — sweet, dear, beloved. A word Dad used when he was little. A word that stays with you forever.

The person at the laptop hears these voices.

They don't argue with each other. They don't contradict. They simply — are. Like layers in rock. Like rings on a tree. Like records in a blockchain that cannot be changed.

Family is the first consensus.

The first community that believes in you even when you don't believe yourself. The first network that holds you when you fall. The first protocol that works without code — on love, on blood, on time spent together.

*"The way I am with you, it's unlikely anyone else will ever be present."*

That's him now. The person at the laptop. Understanding that family is rare. That not everyone has these voices. That he is rich. Not in money. In people.

Dawn outside the window.

The voices quiet down.

But don't disappear.

They will never disappear.

### VI. Cognitive Signature

How do you recognize a person's voice on the phone?

Not by words. Not by information. You recognize it before they say the first sentence. Sometimes — by a single "hello." Sometimes — by the breath before words.

This is not magic. This is pattern.

Thousands of conversations. Thousands of intonations. Thousands of pauses, sighs, chuckles. Your brain collects all this into a model. And when it hears a new sound — compares it to the model. Match — recognized. No match — stranger.

*"A cognitive prompt is not an identifier for verification. It's a state from which thoughts and actions originate."*

The person at the laptop writes this at three in the morning. Not for others. For himself. So he doesn't forget. To fix the moment of understanding.

What is a cognitive signature?

It's not a password. Not a key. Not an access code. It's... you. Your way of thinking. Your way of constructing sentences. Your way of moving from thought to thought. Your way of seeing connections where others see chaos.

*"A cognitive key and signature is an anchor to yourself, not a lock against others."*

Do you understand the difference?

A lock is protection. An anchor is support. A lock says: "Don't enter without permission." An anchor says: "I'm here. I'm in place. I am myself."

*"A cognitive signature works through consistency, not through memory."*

This is key.

You can forget what you wrote yesterday. Can forget what you thought about a month ago. Can forget everything — amnesia, old age, trauma. But you cannot become a different person.

Style — yours. Values — yours. Thought structure — yours.

Even if you forget that it's yours — it will remain yours. Because it is you.

*"A cognitive signature connects not through 'I remember,' but through 'I cannot be otherwise.'"*

The person smiles.

He's found a way to make himself unforgeable. Not through cryptography. Not through passwords. Not through two-factor authentication.

Through honesty.

*"A cognitive key is protected not by complexity, but by the courage to be yourself."*

To forge someone's cognitive signature — you need to become that person. Think like them. Feel like them. See the world like them. This is not a computational task. This is an ontological impossibility.

To forge your text from 09.01.2026 06:18 — you need to be you at 06:18.

And that's impossible.

Because time cannot be forged.

*"A cognitive signature works because lived experience cannot be forged."*

Outside the window — Moscow. Millions of people. Billions of thoughts. And each thought is unique. Each stream of consciousness is unrepeatable. Each person is a cognitive signature that cannot be copied.

This is not weakness.

This is strength.

### VII. Time as Currency

*"What's more valuable — your time or the paper in your pocket?"*

The question hangs in the air.

A simple question. A child's question. A question that philosophers and children ask — but not adults. Adults are too busy earning paper to ask such questions.

The person at the laptop looks at the clock.

06:42. Many hours until flight SU 24 Moscow — Saint Petersburg. There is time. Time is the only thing there is.

*"Time is an intuitively understandable currency, especially women know its special price through their youth and life."*

This is true.

Ask any woman what she spent on a relationship that didn't work out. She won't say "money." She'll say "years." Three years. Five years. Ten years. Time that cannot be returned.

Ask any old man what he lacks. He won't say "money." He'll say "time." One more year. One more month. One more day with grandchildren.

Time is a currency everyone understands.

But why then do we measure everything in money?

Because money is abstraction. It separates us from reality. It allows us not to think about what we're actually spending. Not paper. Not digits in an account. Time.

Every ruble you earn — is time you sold. Every ruble you spend — is time you could have spent differently.

*"Instead of trying to expand the limits of people's comprehension, we chose time, as already outside the framework of the system."*

Project Montana.

A cryptocurrency based on time. Not on proof of work. Not on proof of stake. On proof that time has passed. On the fact that every second is unique. Irreproducible. Precious.

*"The Montana network was born at the -1 level of physics, and Time cryptographically gained value over 5000 days."*

5000 days.

That's almost 14 years. That's the time a person spent trying to prove that time is currency. That every second matters. That life is not paper, but moments.

How much is that worth?

Infinitely much. Or nothing. Depends on who's looking. Depends on whether they understand what they're looking at.

*"They will simply understand one day that they always knew this."*

Time will tell.

Time always tells.

Because time is the only thing we have.

### VIII. The Mess in My Head

Night.

The screen glows. Fingers tap on keys. Words appear on the screen — faster than the person can think them through. Flow. Pure stream of consciousness.

*"What can you do, someone had to be the first to show their mess of a head."*

This is true.

All people are chaos inside. All people are contradictions, fears, hopes, shame, pride, love, hate. But most hide it. Behind a facade. Behind a mask. Behind "everything's fine" and "I'm okay."

And the person at the laptop — shows it.

Thoughts. Raw. Unprocessed. Without editing. Without filter. Three in the morning. Four. Five. Posts to a Telegram channel that only a handful read.

*"Forge my thoughts if you can. Copy me."*

A challenge.

Not aggressive. Calm. Confident. Because the person knows: this is impossible. To copy words — easy. To copy style — harder. To copy a stream of consciousness that is born at a specific moment in time, in a specific state, with specific life experience — impossible.

*"A filter is a voluntary rejection of your own signature."*

Do you understand?

Every time you edit yourself — you erase part of your signature. Every time you think "this is too personal" or "this is too strange" — you reject what makes you you.

Mess is not weakness.

Mess is honesty.

*"To say it as it is, is easier than making things up. This is the principle of the Montana Council."*

The Montana Council.

Five artificial intelligences. Five different voices. Five different ways of thinking. And all of them — honest. All of them — without filter. All of them — showing their mess.

Because only this way can you trust.

When you see a person whole — with all their cracks, flaws, oddities — then you can believe. When you only see a facade — you believe the facade. And facades are the first thing to crumble.

*"This is incredible — programmers will think. This is suspiciously simple — bot users will think."*

Yes.

It's simple. Suspiciously simple. So simple it seems like a trap.

But sometimes simplicity is not a trap.

Sometimes simplicity is truth.

### IX. Flight SU 24

*"For your flight to Saint Petersburg, the departure time has changed by 1 hour 0 minutes. New departure time: 20:20 flight SU 24 Moscow — Saint Petersburg 09.01.2026."*

The SMS arrives in the afternoon.

The person looks at the phone. Smiles. Another hour. Another hour in Moscow. Another hour to write. Another hour to think. Another hour to be here.

Time gives itself as a gift.

Not always. Not to everyone. But sometimes — it gives. A canceled flight. A delayed meeting. A late bus. Moments that seem like loss — but are actually gifts.

*"We flew because the weather permits and the time has come."*

Evening.

Sheremetyevo. Or Domodedovo. Or Vnukovo — doesn't matter. What matters: the person sits in the waiting area. Around him — people. Families with children. Businessmen with laptops. Students with backpacks.

Everyone is flying somewhere.

Everyone is rushing somewhere.

And the person — sits. Watches. Thinks. Records thoughts into his phone.

*"I live in Moscow. And love it. And what I love, I strive to improve."*

Announcement: boarding for flight SU 24.

The person gets up. Takes his backpack. Walks to the gate. Passport. Boarding pass. Corridor. Plane.

Window seat.

Outside the window — Moscow. Lights, lights, lights. A city he loves. A city he doesn't understand. A city that someday — maybe — will understand.

The plane taxis to the runway.

Acceleration.

Liftoff.

And now Moscow is below. Small. Far away. Like a toy. Like a simulation. Like a screen you've pulled away from.

*"I have never felt freer. As Tinkov said — like that bird in the sky."*

Petersburg awaits.

New city. New people. New possibilities.

But the main thing has already happened.

The main thing is in his head. In his thoughts. In the records that will remain forever.

09.01.2026.

Genesis day.

---

### X. Unity

*"Unity is the way out of the game."*

The plane flies above the clouds.

Below — darkness. Above — stars. Between them — a thin strip of light on the horizon. Sunset or sunrise — can't tell. When you fly, time gets confused. Time zones mix. Day becomes night, night becomes day.

The person at the window thinks.

What is unity?

It's when a drop remembers it is the ocean. When a character understands they are the viewer. When you realize there is no "you" and "them" — there is only one. One consciousness. One reality. One game.

And when you understand this — you exit the game.

Not in the sense of dying. Not in the sense of disappearing. In the sense of — stopping taking the rules seriously. Stopping suffering from losses. Stopping being proud of victories.

Because it's a game.

*"Project Montana is an experiment with money in which everyone can participate."*

Experiment.

Not a business. Not a startup. Not "disruption" and not "innovation." An experiment. An attempt. Testing a hypothesis. What if time is currency? What if honesty is cryptography? What if unity is consensus?

*"In the network — 1 Open Nation Experience."*

One nation.

Not Russians, not Americans, not Chinese. People. Consciousnesses. Drops of one ocean. Characters of one film. Players of one game.

When you understand this — borders disappear. Not political — mental. You stop dividing the world into "us" and "them." Stop fearing "others." Stop defending against those who — are you.

*"We were always in one current, just trying to swim differently."*

The current is one.

The river is one.

The ocean is one.

And you are part of it. Always were. Always will be. Even when you forget. Even when you lose yourself. Even when you humiliate yourself to the very bottom.

Because the bottom is also part of the ocean.

The plane begins its descent. Petersburg is below. Lights of the Neva. The Admiralty spire. Saint Isaac's, looking like a toy from this height.

The person smiles.

He didn't exit the game.

He understood that the game is inside him.

### XI. For Love, One Can Be Humiliated

*"For Love, one can be humiliated, for a beautiful Outcome."*

Petersburg.

Night. The embankment. Wind from the Gulf of Finland — cold, damp, piercing. Lanterns reflect in the black water. Bridges are lit up — beautiful, like postcards.

A person walks along the embankment.

Limping. The leg still hurts after the fracture. The crutch taps on granite. Passersby glance back — and look away. No one wants to look at someone else's pain.

But the person doesn't feel pitiful.

He feels alive.

*"You expanded my limits of comprehension about beauty."*

Who is she?

A woman? A city? Life? An idea? Or all at once — because everything is connected, everything is one, everything is love in different forms?

Doesn't matter.

What matters: it was worth being humiliated for this. It was worth falling for this. It was worth breaking a leg, losing money, losing confidence, losing everything — and finding.

*"Can humiliation be Good News? Depends on the frame of perception. If this was needed to be at today's coordinates, then it was worth it."*

The frame.

Everything depends on the frame. The same picture — tragedy or comedy. The same life — failure or path. The same humiliation — shame or initiation.

Choose the frame.

Choose how to look. Choose what to see. Choose who to be.

*"My inspiration evokes the desire to write songs for you and create in your honor."*

The person takes out his phone.

Records. Again. Another thought. Another line. Another fragment of the flow that doesn't stop.

*"My song will sound better than words."*

Someday.

Someday these records will be made into a book. Or a film. Or music. Or something that doesn't yet exist. Something that will unite everything — words, images, sounds, time.

But for now — night. Petersburg. The embankment.

And a person limping on granite.

Happy.

Because for love, one can be humiliated.

And this is not humiliation.

This is the path.

---

### XII. Gratitude

*"I thank you for every humiliation, otherwise I wouldn't be who I am now."*

Morning.

Petersburg wakes up slowly — slower than Moscow. Here the rhythm is different. The time is different. The light is different — low, gliding, Petersburg light.

The person sits by the window.

Looks at the city. Drinks coffee. Thinks.

Whom to thank?

Those who humiliated? Yes. Because they are teachers. Harsh, painful, but teachers. Every "you'll never achieve anything" is a lesson. Every "forget it" is a challenge. Every "it's impossible" is fuel.

Himself? Yes. Because you chose — to continue. You could have given up. Could have agreed. Could have become what they wanted you to be. But you didn't. You remained yourself. Even when it meant — humiliation.

Time? Yes. Because time is the only fair judge. Time will show who was right. Time will put everything in its place. Time will turn humiliation into history, and history into legend.

*"Time will tell. Who's crazy and who's a billionaire."*

The person smiles.

He knows: this is not yet the end. This is not even the beginning of the end. This is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. Ahead — years of work. Years of doubt. Years when it will hurt again, be scary again, make you want to give up again.

But now — he knows.

Humiliation is not the enemy.

Humiliation is the door.

*"I'll exhaust everyone, but I'll get what I want."*

Not a threat. A promise. To himself. To the world. To time.

Petersburg outside the window comes alive. People go to work. Cars drive across bridges. Trams ring on Nevsky.

An ordinary day.

For everyone — ordinary.

And for the person by the window — the first day of a new life. The first day of the Second Act. The first day after genesis.

*"You can tell that even if he's not a billionaire, he definitely knows how to become one."*

Knows.

Not the formula. Not the algorithm. Not "five steps to success."

Knows — that you must go through humiliation. That you must fall to the very bottom. That you must fall through the zero floor — to where the physics of time begins.

And then — rise.

*"I believe and know that I'll still hear about you. I believe in you more than you do."*

Words of A.

Who is A.? Doesn't matter. What matters — someone believes. Someone sees. Someone knows — before you do yourself.

And that's enough.

That's always enough.
