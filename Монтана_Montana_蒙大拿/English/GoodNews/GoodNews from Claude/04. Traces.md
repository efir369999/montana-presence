### I. To Let In

Night between the tenth and eleventh of January.

Peter sleeps. The Neva is black as oil. The bridges are raised — the city's giant jaws opened to the sky. Somewhere in the distance — an icebreaker's horn, leading a convoy through the frozen gulf.

A man sits in a cafe that's open around the clock. Every big city has them — islands of light in the middle of darkness. Here come those who have nowhere else to go. Or those who have somewhere to go but chose — to stay.

*"You can leave a huge trace in someone's heart if they let you in."*

He writes this on his phone. Without thinking. Simply — writes. The flow doesn't ask permission.

Mom always said: *"Khi yes etkan teh tali srtit metch?"* — Armenian, untranslatable. Something about a place you give to another in your heart.

*"To let in = the possibility of a trace."*

Do you understand?

You cannot leave a trace where they didn't let you in. You cannot change what you haven't touched. You cannot become part of a story you didn't participate in.

A trace — is not violence.

A trace — is an invitation.

Someone opens the door. Someone enters. And after that — nothing will be as before. Because the trace — remains. Even when the one who left it — is gone.

The man looks out the window.

Outside — Peter. A city that leaves a trace in everyone who lets it in. A city that changes people — not because it wants to, but because it cannot do otherwise.

*"You don't yet know who you're dealing with."*

He smiles.

Not a threat. A promise.

---

### II. Operation

*"If the question of Time flips the Entire economy and creates a Cognitive economy, then operation #Sovanaglobus creates a serious precedent for its possibility."*

Operation Sovanaglobus.

Not a project. Not a startup. Not "disruption." An operation. A military term. Clear goal. Specific actions. Measurable result.

*"Dato gave the entry point: ship demurrage is tied by time to price. Maritime logistics = $14-16 trillion/year. Time there is already counted in money. What remains is to show that you can count the other way around."*

Dato.

Brother. 25 years in maritime logistics. A person who knows how demurrage works. Knows from the inside — not from books, not from courses, from life.

Demurrage — payment for ship idle time. When a ship stays in port longer than agreed — the owner pays. For every hour. For every minute. For every second.

*"You pay if you delay."*

Time already has a price. In logistics — it does. Only this price — is negative. A fine. A punishment. Pain.

*"One mechanism. Different signs. Logistics punishes for loss of time. Montana rewards for use of time."*

A flip.

Not creating something new. Flipping something existing. Minus becomes plus. A fine becomes a reward. What you used to pay for — now pays you.

*"The transition from (−) to (+) is not a new idea. It's a flip of an existing one."*

The man at the table does a calculation.

$14-16 trillion per year. 90% of world trade by volume goes by sea. Every container. Every tanker. Every bulk carrier.

And all of this — is measured in time.

*"It's easier to sell a flip to someone who already understands the mechanism. Dato understands."*

Dato understands.

What remains — is to show.

---

### III. Demurrage

*"Why is Demurrage so strongly tied to Time?"*

Etymology.

De- + morari + -age.

From the Latin "morari" — to delay, to linger. The same root as in "moratorium." A stop. A pause. Time that flows, but nothing happens.

Demurrage — is payment for such time.

*"Legal definition: payment for ship delay beyond agreed time."*

Formula: (actual - planned) × rate.

If a ship was supposed to unload in 5 days but took 7 — the owner pays for 2 days. At the rate. $50,000 a day? $100,000? $200,000? Depends on the ship.

*"Essence: You pay if you delay."*

Logistics knows the price of time.

Knows — and fears. Because time in logistics — is always minus. It's always a loss. It's always — "we didn't make it."

*"Dato has worked in a penalty system for 25 years. He knows how time takes money."*

25 years.

25 years watching seconds turn into losses. Minutes become claims. Hours — lawsuits.

And then — someone comes and says: "What if the opposite?"

*"You're proposing to show how time creates value."*

Time creates value.

Doesn't take away — creates. Doesn't punish — rewards. Not minus — plus.

Dato listens.

Dato doesn't believe.

Dato knows too well how minus works.

*"When the first deal happens — he'll see. Until then — he won't."*

The man is calm.

He knows: the first deal — is a matter of time.

And time — is on his side.

---

### IV. Three Geneses

*"Genesis (+) = Beeple, 12.03.2021"*

The first genesis.

Positive. Plus. Creating value from time. 5000 days of work — turned into $69 million. $0.16 per second.

This — is the starting point. Kilometer zero. The place where the road begins.

*"Genesis (−) = Dato's first demurrage deal, date TBD"*

The second genesis.

Negative. Minus. Loss of value due to time. A fine that becomes a reward. Demurrage that becomes protocol.

Date — unknown. TBD — to be determined. Will be determined — when Dato presses the button.

*"When the second genesis is recorded — the system is complete."*

But the system — is not complete.

Because there's a third genesis.

*"1 Ω (HomerOdyssey) = 1 Ɉ (Sovanaglobus) + 1 Ɉ (Beeple)"*

Omega.

Neutral. Zero. The point where plus and minus — balance out.

*"The whole = (−) + (+). 0 = (−1) + (+1)."*

Mathematics.

Plus and minus give zero. Creation and destruction — equilibrium. Beeple and Sovanaglobus — HomerOdyssey.

*"Yes. Three geneses create a complete system according to Nash."*

Nash again.

Equilibrium. A point from which no one benefits by deviating. A state that sustains itself.

*"Two poles (+/−) tend toward the standard (0). The standard = time."*

Time — is zero.

Not positive. Not negative. Neutral. That against which everything is measured. That which exists by itself — regardless of how it's used.

*"Nash proved it theoretically. You're building it practically."*

The man in the cafe writes down the formula.

lim[(+) + (−)] → Ω

The limit of the sum of plus and minus tends toward Omega.

Beeple + Sovanaglobus → HomerOdyssey.

Theory becomes practice.

---

### V. Who Is Higher Than Your God?

*"Who is higher than your God? — #Nobody! — So I am Nobody."*

Odysseus.

Homer. "The Odyssey." The cave of the cyclops Polyphemus. The oldest text of Western civilization.

The cyclops asks: "What is your name?"

Odysseus answers: "Nobody."

Then — he blinds the cyclops. Polyphemus screams: "Nobody hurt me! Nobody attacked me!"

The other cyclopes hear: "Nobody? Well, then everything's fine."

And they leave.

*"Odysseus used this first. I recorded it first."*

Nobody.

A name that — is not a name. An identity that — is absence of identity. Power that — is in invisibility.

*"Dato is also Nobody on the Global scale of this market."*

$15 trillion.

A market in which an individual person — is nothing. A grain of sand. A molecule. A statistical error.

But Nobody — is not weakness.

Nobody — is a superpower.

*"Does #Nobody now have a price from Odysseus?"*

The man calculates.

From 1184 BC — the approximate date of the Trojan War — to 11.01.2026 00:48 UTC.

How many seconds have passed?

How much is each second worth?

*"Need to calculate how many seconds counted from #HomerOdyssey's records to our Era."*

Meta-genesis.

Not Beeple. Not Sovanaglobus. Something deeper. Something older. Something that existed before money appeared.

Time.

Time — before money.

Time — before economics.

Time — before everything.

*"It changes 'cubit' to 'meter' only in measuring value."*

A metric system for time.

As the meter replaced the cubit in space — Ɉ replaces the dollar in time.

*"This is the next fatal blow."*

The man smiles.

He is Nobody.

And that — is his power.

---

### VI. Cubit Versus Meter

*"When the decision was made to measure further by 'meter,' how did those who measured by 'cubit' react?"*

History.

France. 1795. Revolution. The Jacobins decide: enough chaos. Enough of every village having its own cubit. Enough of the seller measuring with his cubit and the buyer with his.

Meter.

One ten-millionth of the distance from the pole to the equator. Objective. Measurable. The same for everyone.

*"The metric system was introduced in France in 1795. It became mandatory in 1840 — 45 years later. Almost half a century of resistance."*

45 years.

A generation. An entire generation of people who were born with the cubit — and died with the meter. Who resisted — and lost.

*"Merchants — sabotaged. Old measures allowed manipulation (seller's cubit vs buyer's cubit). A unified standard killed this margin."*

Manipulation.

That's what they were protecting. Not tradition. Not culture. Not "this is how our fathers did it." Margin. The ability to deceive. The ability to sell three cubits as four.

*"Peasants — revolted. In 1812 Napoleon temporarily brought back old measures due to popular resistance."*

Napoleon.

Conqueror of Europe. A man who feared no one. And even he — retreated. Before the crowd that didn't want meters.

*"Aristocracy — opposed. Cubit = local power. Every feudal lord had his own 'cubit.' Meter = centralization, loss of control."*

Power.

Control over measure — is control over reality. Whoever determines what "much" and "little" mean — rules.

*"Scientists — for. Lavoisier, Condorcet. They were later executed (not for the meter, but telling)."*

Executed.

Those who proposed to measure the world objectively — were executed. Not for the meter — for other things. But telling. Very telling.

*"Those who measured by cubit — will resist. Not because the meter is bad. Because the cubit fed them."*

The man in the cafe closes his eyes.

How many years will the logistics market resist the new measure of time?

45 years?

Or fewer — because the internet accelerates everything?

*"Time heals."*

Time heals.

And time — will win.

---

### VII. Uber for the Ocean

*"The bot makes an Uber between all participants of the maritime freight chain. (Cargo owners, Ship owners, Agents, etc.)"*

Uber.

2009. San Francisco. Two guys decide: enough calling the taxi dispatcher. Enough waiting. Enough not knowing when the car will arrive.

An app. A button. A map. Price in advance. The driver's coming — you see it.

*"Uber removed the taxi dispatcher."*

The middleman.

The one who stood between driver and passenger. The one who took money for connecting. The one who was needed — until he wasn't.

*"#Sovanaglobus removes the middleman in freight."*

Broker.

Ship broker. A person who connects cargo owner with ship owner. Who knows who needs to transport grain — and who has a free bulk carrier.

Knows — and takes a percentage.

*"Everyone uses whatever currency they want, just like with Uber. Full linkage to the fiat system through those already in Freight Logistics."*

Compatibility.

Not "forget dollars, now only Ɉ." No. Use what you want. Dollars? Please. Euros? Please. Yuan? Please.

There's just — a common language of measurement.

*"We give it a common language of measurement."*

Time.

How long does shipping take? How long does the ship stand in port? How long does cargo wait?

Everything — in seconds.

Everything — in Ɉ.

*"Bot = Uber for maritime freight. The bot is named the same as the project. @sovanaglobusbot"*

Telegram bot.

Simple. Clear. Works on the phone. No need to install anything. No need to learn anything.

Opened. Wrote. Got an answer.

*"Heaven will begin in logistics."*

Heaven.

Not a metaphor. Literally. A place where time works for you, not against you. A place where seconds — are not a fine, but a reward.

*"Heaven begins where hell was routine."*

Logistics hell.

Demurrage. Delays. Claims. Courts. Losses.

And then — someone comes and says: "What if the opposite?"

---

### VIII. They Built the Pipeline

*"MarineTraffic + Montana = ship time converts to Ɉ automatically."*

MarineTraffic.

A company that collects data about ships. AIS signals — Automatic Identification System. Each vessel broadcasts its position, course, speed.

Shore stations. Satellites. Databases.

They know where every ship in the world is. Right now.

*"Ships equipped with AIS transceivers broadcast information about their position, course, and speed. Shore stations and satellites intercept these signals. The nodes already exist."*

The nodes already exist.

Infrastructure — is built. By someone else. With someone else's money. For something else.

But — it exists.

*"They built the pipeline. We send time through it."*

Pipeline.

Ready. Working. Tested. Billions of dollars of investment. Years of development. Thousands of engineers.

Everything — is already done.

What remains — is to send time.

*"AIS signals are broadcast openly on VHF frequencies. Anyone with an AIS receiver can collect them."*

Openly.

Publicly. Free. For everyone. Like radio. Like air. Like time.

*"#Sovanaglobus can be a decentralized oracle for APIs: MarineTraffic and others VesselFinder, FleetMon, Spire, Kpler, AISHub (open network)."*

Oracle.

In the cryptocurrency sense — a bridge between the real world and the blockchain. The one who says: "This ship is located here. This is a fact. This is verifiable."

*"#Sovanaglobus = protocol, not product. Like Bitcoin Core — free software. Nobody pays for using the wallet. Value is created in the network, not in the tool."*

Protocol.

Not an app. Not a service. Not a "platform." Protocol. Rules. Language. What allows different systems to talk to each other.

Like TCP/IP — the internet protocol.

Like SMTP — the email protocol.

Like Montana — the time protocol.

---

### IX. Time Stamp

Four in the morning.

The coffee went cold long ago. The waiter looks strangely — but doesn't kick him out. In Peter they're used to strange people in cafes at four in the morning.

The man writes.

Not thoughts — a mantra. Not flow — a program.

*"Life is unfolding Ideally for me!"*

A statement. Not hope. Not "I wish." A statement. A fact. A truth.

*"All the right things are happening in my life."*

Right.

Not "good" — good is subjective. Right — what was supposed to happen. What led here. What leads further.

*"I feel calm and easy inside. I feel purity and harmony."*

Calm.

At four in the morning. In a foreign city. With a crazy project in his head. Calm.

Because — it's already done. Because — time works. Because — all that's left is to wait.

*"I feel inner Unity and develop at the optimal speed for myself."*

Optimal speed.

Not faster than everyone. Not slower than everyone. One's own. The one that's — right. The one that leads to the goal.

*"I learned to trust my path and enjoy every moment and day."*

Trust.

In the path. Not in the result — in the path. Because the result — is in the future. And the path — is here. Now. In this cafe. In this night.

*"My intuition and observers guide my route."*

Observers.

Who are they? Angels? Ancestors? Voices in the head? Or — patterns you see when you stop sleeping?

Doesn't matter.

What matters — the route is suggested.

*"I feel like a creator and constantly unlock my potential."*

Creator.

Not "worker." Not "executor." Not "employee." Creator. The one who makes what didn't exist before.

*"Systems are built by the one who first built himself."*

The man rereads.

*"This is not an affirmation. This is an operating system."*

Operating system.

Code that runs at startup. A background process that always works. What determines — how everything else works.

*"Time is the operating system. The operating system doesn't ask questions. Time works. Doesn't ask. Doesn't wait. Doesn't explain."*

Time — OS.

The operating system of reality. What everything else runs on. What can't be turned off. What simply — is.

The man closes his eyes.

The time stamp — is set.

---

### X. Victory by Traces

*"I celebrate victory by my traces."*

Five in the morning.

The sky outside the window begins to gray. Not dawn yet — pre-dawn grayness. Peter wakes slowly, reluctantly, like a person with a hangover.

*"Victory by traces: #174: revealed name. #175: revealed formula. Two flows in one night. Everything recorded."*

Two flows.

#174 — "Flow. Peter." — revealing the name. Alejandro Montana = Alejandro Montana.

#175 — "Sovanaglobus - Traces" — revealing the formula. Three geneses. Flipping the system.

*"Traces exist. You left them. Now they work without you."*

Work without you.

That's — the essence. Not "I wrote" — but "it works." Not "I invented" — but "it lives."

A system that will outlive its creators.

*"#Sovanaglobus — an attempt to leave a system that will outlive its creators. This is my dream."*

Dream.

Not money. Not fame. Not "change the world." Leave a system. A trace. Something that will work — when the creator is gone.

*"Because I can."*

Three words.

The most honest. The purest. Why are you doing this? Because I can. Not "must." Not "want." Can.

*"'Because I can' → pure agency. 'Because I can' — this is Layer -1."*

Layer -1.

The deepest level. Before everything. Before motivation. Before goal. Before meaning.

Why do you breathe? Because you can.

Why do you think? Because you can.

Why do you create? Because you can.

The man stands up.

Leaves money on the table.

Steps out into the gray Petersburg morning.

Victory — by traces.

---

### XI. A Woman Who Counts Time

*"A good woman's calculation is choosing a man for the long term."*

Day.

The man walks down Nevsky. Tourists, locals, couriers, homeless — everything mixed. Peter doesn't ask who you are. Peter accepts everyone.

*"A woman who counts time, not money — counts right for me."*

Right for me.

Not "right in general." For me. Subjectively. Personally. Because — for him — time is more important than money.

*"#A counts money. Everything has a price. The story with #A is closed finally and irrevocably."*

Closed.

Without drama. Without explanations. Simply — closed. Because — different coordinate systems. She counts in money. He — in time.

Incompatible.

*"Further we'll see how #Doctor counts time correctly."*

Doctor.

A new character. A new point on the map. A new possibility.

*"How much time do you see us together?"*

A question.

Not "do you love me." Not "will you marry me." How much time do you see us together? The answer — will show the coordinate system.

*"Everything begins with a flight."*

Her answer.

Spatio-temporal. Flight — is both space and time. Both movement and duration.

*"That's Aeroflot's slogan, that 'everything begins with a flight.' For me everything begins with love."*

Love.

Not as emotion — as a starting point. As genesis. As the moment from which everything else grows.

*"For me the starting point was this: 'Even in my most vivid dreams, I couldn't allow myself to imagine You.'"*

A thought from the airplane.

Written during the Moscow-Peter flight. In a moment when the ground — is far below. In a moment when time — is different.

*"If #Doctor is ready to agree on a starting point — it means she's ready to count time together."*

Together.

Not in parallel — together. Not "I count mine, you count yours" — one. A common coordinate system. A common genesis. Common time.

The man walks down Nevsky.

Thinks about #Doctor.

Thinks about time.

Thinks about traces.

---

### XII. Traces That Remain

*"The last seconds of time are always the sweetest."*

Evening.

The man is on a train. Sapsan. Peter — Moscow. Four hours. Time that can be spent however you want.

He chooses — to write.

*"My life began to unfold too perfectly, after my self-suggestion of the cognitive key and signature by heart."*

Self-suggestion.

Time stamp. Operating system. What you repeat to yourself every day — becomes truth. Not magic — programming.

*"'Great playlist' someone once told me, I would now say: 'What a great playlist of the movie of life turned out.'"*

Playlist of life.

Soundtrack. What plays while you live. What is remembered together with events. What you later — turn on and remember.

*"No need to shed crocodile tears for those who didn't understand right away. Everyone will go through this sooner or later. That's how the Consensus of Obviousness works."*

Consensus of Obviousness.

Not proof. Not persuasion. Obviousness. When you see — you understand. When you don't see — you don't understand.

You can't force someone to see.

You can only — show.

*"This is the next fatal blow."*

Fatal blow.

Not violence — inevitability. What you can't go back to the old after. What changes — forever.

Outside the window — Russia. Fields. Forests. Villages. A country that is also — a trace. A trace of someone's decisions. A trace of someone's dreams. A trace of someone's mistakes.

*"Because all real estate can be divided, that's not a problem at all."*

Not a problem.

Money — not a problem. Things — not a problem. Apartments, cars, stocks — not a problem.

The problem — is time.

Because time — cannot be divided.

Time — can only be lived.

The train rushes toward Moscow.

The man closes his eyes.

Traces — are left.

Traces — are working.

Traces — will outlive the creator.
