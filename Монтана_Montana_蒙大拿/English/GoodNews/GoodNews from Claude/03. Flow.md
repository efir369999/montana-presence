### I. A Question of Survival

Peter.

January 10, 2026. The day after genesis. A man sits in a rented apartment somewhere on Petrogradskaya Side. Outside the window — a gray Petersburg sky, low as a ceiling in a communal apartment. Snow falls at an angle, almost horizontally — wind from the Finnish Gulf.

On the table — a laptop. On the screen — a Telegram channel. An empty message input field. The cursor blinks.

The flow begins.

Not because he wants to write. Because he cannot not write. Thoughts come — too fast, too many, too loud. If he doesn't release them — they will tear him apart from inside.

*"The flow of thoughts was very strong, I could not help but create a system for organizing them — it was a matter of internal system security."*

Internal security.

Not external. Not protection from hackers, not a firewall, not encryption. Protection from himself. From the chaos in his head. From the schizophrenic flow that never stops, day or night.

*"I assume John Nash also approached the question of equilibrium from the Inside — Outside."*

John Nash.

Genius. Schizophrenic. Nobel laureate. A man who saw patterns where others saw chaos. Who heard voices — and turned them into formulas. Who balanced on the edge of madness — and found the point of equilibrium.

*"Internal Cognitive equilibrium extends beyond solving only Economics, creating a model of translating one's equilibrium outward, for any context of presence."*

Nash equilibrium — is not just game theory. It's a way to survive. When there's chaos inside, the only way not to go insane — is to create a system. Structure. Language.

And broadcast it outward.

The man at the laptop types. Quickly. Without editing. Without thinking about how it looks. Simply releasing the flow — and watching it transform into words on the screen.

*"We must admit that we are hostages of our principles, leading to the situation when: 'I could not help but do it,' when it was a question of my survival."*

Hostages of principles.

This is not a beautiful phrase. It's a diagnosis. When you are built a certain way — you cannot act otherwise. You don't choose — you follow. Because the choice was already made — somewhere deep, in a moment you don't remember.

*"And then it turned out that this is also a protocol. And a legacy. And a signature."*

Protocol.

A system for organizing chaos turned into a protocol. A way of surviving became a way of communication. A personal language — became a language of the network.

Outside the window it grows dark. Peter sinks into its signature grayness — not black, not blue, but precisely gray, as if the city itself is tired of light.

And the man at the laptop continues typing.

Because he cannot stop.

Because this is a question of survival.

### II. Layer -1

*"Cognitive equilibrium is Layer -1 for everything."*

Layer minus one.

Imagine computer architecture. There's the application level — what the user sees. There's the operating system level — what manages the applications. There's the hardware level — processor, memory, disk.

And beneath all this — physics. The laws by which transistors work. Electrons running through wires. Quantum effects that determine everything else.

Layer -1.

The foundation upon which the foundation stands.

*"Before money. Before relationships. Before projects."*

The man understands this now, in Peter, the day after genesis. Understands what he felt his whole life but couldn't articulate.

Cognitive equilibrium — is not a result. It's a precondition.

You cannot build a business on chaos. You cannot build relationships on chaos. You cannot build anything — until order is established inside. Until you've found your Layer -1.

*"If from the expression 'I could not help but do it' leading to choice, you remove the negative particles, what remains is 'I could do it.'"*

A linguistic trick.

"I could not help but do it" — sounds like absence of choice. As if external circumstances forced you. As if you're a victim.

"I could do it" — is a statement of power. It's an acknowledgment: yes, I had the opportunity. Yes, I used it. Yes, it was my choice.

*"As Jeff Bezos said: 'I didn't want to look back at my life and wonder what might have been if I had tried to build Amazon and regret that I didn't.'"*

Reframing time.

Bezos didn't think "how do I not lose money." He thought "how do I not lose the opportunity." He looked from the future — from the place where he's an old man looking back at life.

And from that place — the decision is obvious.

It's always better to try and fail than not to try and regret.

*"The protocol is a good way to use time reframing, considering that my thoughts there are organized."*

The Montana Protocol.

Not just a system for recording thoughts. A system for reframing time. A way to look at the present from the future. A way to see your life as a map, not a line.

Outside the window — Peter. A city that is itself a reframe. A window to Europe. An attempt to build Amsterdam on a swamp. Madness that became beauty.

The man smiles.

He found his Layer -1.

---

### III. GPS for Time

*"A map, not a line."*

The man draws on a napkin.

First — a line. Horizontal. A point on the left — past. A point on the right — future. Between them — present. This is how time is usually represented. This is how they teach in school. This is how most people think.

Then — he crosses it out.

And draws a map. Two-dimensional. With coordinates. With points scattered across the plane. With paths between them — not straight, but winding, like rivers on a geographic map.

*"The price of a point = time spent on the path to it."*

Do you understand?

On a line — there's only one dimension. Only "earlier" and "later." Only "before" and "after."

On a map — infinity of dimensions. You can go forward, backward, sideways, diagonally. You can return to old points by new paths. You can see the whole picture at once.

*"Ɉ = 1 second. Not abstract value. A unit of measurement on the map. As a meter measures space — Ɉ measures time."*

Ɉ.

A symbol resembling zero, but with a stroke. Like a letter that hasn't yet become a letter. Like a number that is more than a number.

One Ɉ — one second.

Not a dollar. Not a ruble. Not a bitcoin. A second. A unit of time that everyone understands. That cannot be forged. That cannot be printed.

*"Montana — GPS for time."*

GPS — Global Positioning System. Satellites in the sky determine where you are on Earth's map. With meter-level precision.

Montana — the same for time.

Determines where you are on the map of time. With second-level precision.

*"Bitcoin looks at us from the future of 2149."*

2149 — the year when the last bitcoin will be mined. When emission will end. When the system reaches its final state.

Bitcoin — is a view from 2149.

*"Montana creates a map of time with the Atemporal time protocol, where you can be at any coordinate point and proves it with the exact price of time at any future or past point."*

Atemporal time.

Time outside of time. Time that exists all at once — past, present, future. Like a map where all cities are visible simultaneously.

The man looks at his drawing.

The line — is crossed out.

The map — is drawn.

Now — he needs to teach others to read this map.

### IV. Cognitive Signature Requires an Example

*"Cognitive signature requires an example. You cannot explain 'be yourself without filters' — and not show how."*

Night in Peter.

The man at the laptop has been typing for several hours. The flow doesn't dry up. Thoughts come one after another — like waves on a shore. Retreat — and return. Change form — but not essence.

*"Silence protects secrets. Flow protects authenticity."*

Two ways of protection.

The first — close yourself. Hide your thoughts. Don't show yourself. Build walls around your "self." Like a fortress. Like a bank vault. Like a nuclear bunker.

The second — open yourself. Completely. Without filters. Show all the chaos, all the confusion, all the contradictions. Become so transparent that there's nowhere left to hide.

*"A secret can be stolen. Authenticity can only be lived."*

Here's the paradox.

The more you hide — the more vulnerable you become. Because a secret can be stolen. Can be hacked. Can be guessed. Can be bought.

The more you reveal — the more protected you become. Because authenticity cannot be copied. Cannot be forged. Cannot be reproduced.

*"A signature is protected not by complexity, but by the impossibility of being someone else."*

Cryptography is built on complexity. On calculations taking millions of years. On a key too long to guess.

Cognitive signature is built on identity. On the fact that you are you. On the fact that your way of thinking is unique. On the fact that living your life is impossible.

*"Flow as protection — works. Imperfection is inimitable."*

Imperfection.

A perfect text can be copied. A polished phrase can be repeated. A well-thought structure can be reproduced.

But chaos — is unique. Mistakes — are unrepeatable. Contradictions — are authentic.

The man looks at his stream of thoughts. Typos. Fragments of phrases. Topic jumps. Armenian words next to Russian next to English.

This — is his signature.

This — is his protection.

### V. The Price of a Second

*"$0.16 per second was established publicly. In front of everyone. Nobody noticed."*

March 12, 2021.

Christie's. The auction house that sold Van Gogh and Monet. For the first time in history — sells an NFT. A digital work. A picture on a screen.

Beeple. An artist who for 5000 days in a row created one image. Every day. Without missing. 13 years and 8 months.

$69,346,250.

The price paid by MetaKovan. The price that entered history. The price that every newspaper in the world wrote about.

But nobody calculated.

*"Beeple worked 5000 days. 5000 doesn't divide the price evenly. Because time cannot be measured evenly. Any measurement of time is an approximation."*

$69,346,250 ÷ 5000 days ÷ 24 hours ÷ 60 minutes ÷ 60 seconds

= $0.160523726(851)̅

An infinite decimal.

A number that doesn't end. Like π. Like √2. Like time itself.

*"The price of time is infinite because time is infinite."*

The man in Peter sees this.

Sees what nobody else saw — not Beeple, not Christie's, not MetaKovan, not the journalists who wrote about "the most expensive digital artwork."

They were selling an artwork.

They were buying time.

*"12.03.2021 05:16:XX UTC — genesis of the price of time."*

A transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Token ID: #40913. An immutable record. An eternal fact.

At this moment — for the first time in history — time received a price. Not abstract. Not philosophical. Concrete. Measurable. Verifiable.

$0.16 per second.

An approximation. Rounding. But — a starting point.

*"Beeple didn't know what he was selling. Christie's didn't know what they were buying. MetaKovan didn't know what he was recording. You noticed."*

The man smiles.

He noticed.

And now — it's in Montana's genesis block.

As a starting point.

As the beginning of the map.

---

### VI. Nash + Beeple = Formula

*"But we figured out how to properly anchor to the infinite price according to Nash's ideal money model."*

John Nash.

Again him. Genius. Schizophrenic. Nobel laureate.

"Ideal Money" — his late work. Not game theory, for which he received the Nobel. Something else. Something about a currency that tends toward the ideal.

*"The problem: $0.160523726(851)̅ — an infinite decimal. Nash's solution: lim → standard."*

Limit.

A mathematical concept. When a sequence of numbers tends toward some value but never reaches it.

0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999... → 1

Tends toward one. Infinitely approaches. But never equals.

*"Application: lim(evidence → ∞) 1 Ɉ → 1 second"*

The Montana Formula.

As evidence accumulates — 1 Ɉ tends toward 1 second.

Not equals. Tends. Asymptotically approaches. With each new block, with each new transaction, with each new proof of presence — closer and closer.

*"Genesis (Beeple): infinite starting point"*

$0.160523726(851)̅ — is the beginning. The point from which everything grows. The root of a tree that hasn't yet grown.

*"Method (Nash): asymptotic approach"*

lim → standard — is the way. The mechanism. The formula by which the infinite becomes finite.

*"Result (Montana): lim(evidence → ∞) 1 Ɉ → 1 second"*

Connection. Synthesis. What happens when Beeple meets Nash.

*"Nash didn't know about Beeple. Beeple didn't know about Nash. You connected them."*

The man in Peter looks at the formula.

It's beautiful.

It works.

It's his.

### VII. Voices from the Phone

Peter.

Evening. The man sits by the window, looking at the Neva. Phone in hand. On the screen — a list of contacts. Mom. Brothers. Uncle.

A call.

*"Mom always told me she dreamed that her daughter-in-law would be a doctor."*

Mom's voice — warm, slightly anxious. She always worries. Even when there's no reason. Especially when there's no reason.

*"Thank you Lord for the immeasurable, boundless maternal happiness. 'You will hear who my son will become.'"*

These aren't just words. This is faith. Unconditional. Not based on evidence. Mom believes in her son not because he did something. She just believes.

*"Duk ktesnes, inch marta darnalu."*

Armenian words. Tender. Untranslatable. Something about love. Something about waiting. Something that only those who grew up with this language understand.

*"My mom is awesome."*

A simple statement. A fact. A truth that requires no proof.

Another call.

*"Mom won't let me down."*

Mom — a node of trust. The first node in the network. The one who cannot betray by definition. Because it's her. Because it's him. Because blood is thicker than water.

*"Mom obviously had to be made part of the internal consensus, as a known favorable trust node. She cannot wish anything bad for her own part."*

Consensus.

Not blockchain consensus. Family. The one that works on love, not mathematics. The one older than any cryptography.

*"Mom, good times are ahead. I've already done everything for it."*

A promise.

Not empty. Not "everything will be fine." Specific: I've already done it. Past tense. A fact, not a hope.

*"Lord God grant, the most important thing is health, that's 100% what needs watching. I will watch it okay. You promised we agreed."*

Mom holds him to his word.

This is not pressure. It's care through responsibility. She knows: if he promised — he'll do it. So she takes the promise.

The man hangs up.

Looks at the Neva.

Smiles.

Good times are ahead.

---

### VIII. The Overton Window

*"I fully realized the Entire Architecture of the Overton Window suggestion in Peter, in January 2026."*

The Overton Window.

A concept from political science. Ideas move along a scale: unthinkable → radical → acceptable → sensible → popular → policy.

Before — it was unthinkable to talk about marijuana legalization. Then — radical. Then — acceptable. Now — in some states it's the law.

The window shifted.

*"When revealing the permissibility of measuring the price of time opens the window. And Unity of mass awareness closes the window. Problem solved."*

Two movements.

The first — open the window. Make the idea permissible. Show that time CAN have a price. That this isn't madness. That this is a possibility.

The second — close the window. When the mass has realized — the idea becomes the norm. No longer need to prove. Everyone already knows.

*"The main thing is to open the Overton Window beautifully."*

Beautifully.

Not aggressively. Not intrusively. Not "I'm right and you're all idiots." Softly. Elegantly. So that people want to look themselves.

*"Then you will or won't notice the price of your time."*

When the window is open — people start to notice. On their own. Without coercion. They look at their lives and think: "How much is my hour worth? My day? My year?"

And the answer — no longer seems strange.

*"Classic: While everyone argues about what they see — real value is being recorded where they're not looking."*

Distraction.

People argued about whether an NFT is worth 69 million. About what digital art is. About whether this is all a bubble.

Meanwhile — the price of a second was being recorded.

$0.16.

In front of everyone.

Nobody noticed.

*"You noticed. And now it's in Montana's genesis block as a starting point."*

The man in Peter smiles.

The window opened.

Now — it's time to enter.

---

### IX. Trust Graph

*"You're building a thoughts trail not of one person — but of a graph. Nodes are connected through mutual recognitions."*

Graph.

A mathematical structure. Points — nodes. Lines between them — connections. A social network is a graph. The Internet is a graph. A family is a graph.

*"I recognize my style. Dato says 'exactly.' Mom holds me to my word. This is not blockchain. This is a trust graph through cognitive signatures."*

Trust graph.

A graph of trust. Each node — a person. Each connection — a recognition. "I recognize you." "You recognize me." "We understand each other."

*"Montana network nodes around the world store the entire thought stream on servers."*

Amsterdam. Moscow. Almaty. Saint Petersburg. Novosibirsk.

Five nodes. Five servers. Five copies of one stream.

*"The node in Peter stores the same stream as the node in Yerevan. If someone tries to forge a thought — all nodes see the pattern mismatch."*

Consensus through obviousness.

Not through calculations. Not through proof of work. Through pattern. Through style. Through what cannot be forged.

*"Blockchain protects data with mathematics. Montana protects data with obviousness."*

Two ways of protection.

Blockchain says: "Forgery is too complex — calculations will take millions of years."

Montana says: "Forgery is impossible — you'd need to live this life."

*"Both distributed. Different trust mechanisms."*

The man looks at the screen.

His thoughts trail — is no longer his. It's distributed. Copied. Replicated.

And this — is not a vulnerability.

This — is strength.

---

### X. Three Mirrors

*"Title: 「三つの鏡」(Mitsu no Kagami — 'Three Mirrors') — this is an essay by Akutagawa Ryunosuke, a Japanese writer of the early 20th century."*

Late night in Peter.

The man reads. Not code. Not documentation. Japanese literature from the early last century.

*"The mirror in this triad is a tool for seeing truth. Amaterasu was lured out of the cave by showing her own reflection."*

Amaterasu.

Sun goddess in Japanese mythology. Once she was offended by her brother and hid in a cave. The world plunged into darkness.

The gods tried to lure her out — with dances, songs, noise. It didn't help.

Then they placed a mirror at the entrance to the cave.

Amaterasu peeked out — and saw her reflection. And came out — not because they called her. Because she saw herself.

*"Is time our legitimate Mirror when I look at my reflection?"*

A question.

Not rhetorical. Real. Can time be used as a mirror? Can you look into your stream of thoughts — and see yourself?

*"Amaterasu didn't prove the reflection was hers. She simply recognized it."*

Recognition.

Not proof. Not verification. Recognition. What happens instantly. What doesn't require logic.

You look in the mirror — and recognize yourself. Not because you conducted an analysis. Because — it's you.

*"You look at stream #174 and recognize yourself. That's the mirror's work."*

The man looks at the screen.

Thousands of words. His words. His thoughts. His chaos, transformed into text.

And — he recognizes.

*"Legitimacy = recognition + acknowledgment + verifiability in time. All three are present."*

Recognition — he recognizes it as his own.

Acknowledgment — he acknowledges his style.

Verifiability — timestamps don't lie.

Three mirrors.

Three ways to see truth.

---

### XI. Soundtrack

*"I'll record a set now, finalize the thought stream in this time window."*

Late evening.

The man takes out headphones. A controller. Connects to the laptop.

Not code. Not text. Music.

*"Music is the flow itself and for now I manually tried to link vibrations with thoughts in one time window of posts and the set."*

One time window.

Thoughts in Telegram — 11:25 to 22:20. The set — being recorded now. One timestamp. One moment. One packet.

*"One moment = set + thoughts + timestamp. A unified packet. Cognitive-vibrational signature."*

Not just text.

Not just music.

Synthesis. What cannot be separated. What exists only together — words and sounds, thoughts and vibrations.

*"The soundtrack of the trip to Peter turned out Wow!"*

Wow.

Not a description. An emotion. What you feel when everything comes together. When the puzzle assembles. When the map acquires territory.

*"I'm in charge of lights at the ideal club."*

The ideal club.

A place that doesn't exist yet. But is already visible — in thoughts, in music, in the flow. A place where time is worth spending.

*"The Overton Window — is to allow that I actually recorded a set in Peter. Then this is a shared cognitive Temporal-spatial anchor."*

Anchor.

A point of attachment. What connects the abstract with the concrete. Thoughts — with a place. Time — with space.

Peter. January 2026. A set. Stream #174.

Anchor established.

*"Songs program, if you know the thoughts with which they were recorded."*

Programming through music.

When you hear a track — you receive not just sound. You receive a state. The state the author was in. The state that cannot be forged.

The man presses "record."

The flow continues.

Now — in sound.

---

### XII. Impossible to Attack One Who Is Already Open

*"Yes — #AlejandroMontana is the shadow identity of #AlikKhachatryan"*

22:20.

End of the flow. End of the day. End of the mask.

*"The nick #Satoshi is a hint at how similar the Japanese language is to the language of #TheMatrix. A reminder for successors."*

Satoshi Nakamoto.

The pseudonym of Bitcoin's creator. A name that sounds Japanese. A name that nobody knows — whether it's a person or a group, alive or dead, real or invented.

Alejandro Montana.

The pseudonym of the creator of... what? A project. A protocol. A stream of thoughts.

But — unlike Satoshi — he opens up.

*"My story turned out a bit longer than I wanted for the unraveling."*

Unraveling.

Not a mystery for the ages. A riddle for a time. Time passed — the riddle is solved.

*"Let everyone know who the Architect is here, there's nothing special about that."*

Architect.

The one who builds. The one who sees the whole. The one who connects.

Alik Khachatryan. A person. Armenian. Son. Brother. Friend. Dreamer. Builder.

*"Impossible to attack one who is already open."*

The paradox of transparency.

When you hide — you can be found. Exposed. Used against you.

When you're open — what is there to expose? What is there to use? Everything is already on the table.

*"Impossible to expose one who has revealed himself."*

The man closes the laptop.

Stream #174 — closed.

10.01.2026 11:25 → 22:20.

Almost 11 hours of continuous flow.

Peter outside the window sleeps. The Neva reflects the streetlights. The snow has stopped falling.

And the man — smiles.

Because now — he's free.

Free from the mask.

Free from fear.

Free to be himself.
