# Chapter IV. Comedy `[00:00 — 15:21]`

*A Tale of the Beginning of Time*
*Day Four*

---

## I. Morning of the Fourth Day `[00:00]`

Moscow. 15.01.2026. 11:30.

Nothing wakes up. Outside the window — winter sun, a rare guest in January. He reaches for the phone, checks messages.

— Grisha writes the comedy, not you, — he reads aloud someone's message.

Laughter.

— Everything in my film — is exclusively my evaluative judgments, of presumptive nature.

He gets up, walks to the window.

— "Eternal Comedy of King Nothing" — is a journey on a boat of absolute determination in the whirlpool of Mr. Nothing's thoughts.

Camera shows his silhouette against the light.

— We don't laugh at anyone at the beginning. We laugh at everyone at once — and only at the end, when the picture is complete.

Pause.

— This is my contemporary art. The opportunity to express my thoughts in the most protected network with cognitive signatures.

**Give me the words, or tell me Nothing. In a Manner of Speaking.**

---

## II. Cognitive Key `[00:58]`

Balcony. Nothing stands with phone in hands.

— My cognitive key is in my manner of speaking, — he pronounces in English. — I give words, but say nothing.

Camera approaches his face.

— Understand? My cognitive key — is in the manner of speech. I give words, but say Nothing.

He smirks at his own wordplay.

— This is called "strategic ambiguity". Or implied association. How does it work?

A diagram appears on screen:

```
1. You mention Cicada 3301 in the context of your project
2. You don't say "we are them"
3. You don't say "we are not them"
4. The audience fills in the connection themselves
```

— Cicada 3301, — he continues. — Remember? 2012. Puzzles on 4chan. Steganography. Cryptography. Coordinates in 14 cities around the world. Including Moscow.

Pause.

— 13 years ago they showed you a picture and posed a riddle, leaving your TOTE open until now. The thirst for TOTE closure of this magnitude — is even stronger.

**Cicada 3301 = Trinity (303) + Neo (1). But that's not certain.**

---

## III. Cicada `[02:11]`

Darkness. An image appears on screen — black background, white text, a cicada.

Voice off-screen reads:

*"Hello. We are looking for highly intelligent individuals. To this end we have devised a test. There is a message hidden in this image. Find it, and it will show you how to find us. We look forward to meeting the few who will make it all the way through. Good luck. 3301"*

Light turns on. Nothing sits at the table.

— A cicada lives underground for 13 or 17 years — prime numbers. Then emerges.

He looks at the camera.

— How many years old is Bitcoin, can you tell me?

Pause.

— 17 years. Launched January 9, 2009. Cicada appeared in 2012 — 3 years after Bitcoin, 13 years before 2025.

A timeline appears on screen:

```
2009: Bitcoin (0)
2012: Cicada 3301 (0)
     | 13 years
25.12.2025: Montana beginning
     | transition
2026: Publication (17 years Bitcoin, ~14 years Cicada)
```

— We started December 25, 2025 marking 13 years, — says Nothing. — And we publish in 2026 marking the 17-year Cicada cycle.

He draws on paper: 3301:1033

— Time and its mirror. Entry and exit simultaneously.

**Riddles are over. For thinkers, answers began in different languages.**

---

## IV. Filter Inversion `[03:40]`

Room. Nothing paces back and forth.

— Cicada gave puzzles — filtered out those who wouldn't solve them.

He stops.

— Montana gives answers — filters out those who don't see.

Camera approaches his face.

— Understand the inversion? Cicada sought those who would solve. We seek those who will see.

Text appears on screen:

```
CICADA 3301:
Puzzle -> Solution -> Entry
Filter: who DOESN'T solve — filtered out

MONTANA:
Answer -> Understanding -> Entry
Filter: who DOESN'T see — filtered out
```

— The puzzle wasn't in the words, — he continues. — The puzzle is that the code is open — and no one looks. Everyone reads philosophy, argues about "cognitive consensus" — and the system already works.

He points to the screen with GitHub:

```
https://github.com/efir369999/junomontanaagibot
```

— Orangutans self-eliminate. That's our best Sybil protection.

**How will you prove you're not an Orangutan? Have you parsed the entire repository?**

---

## V. Three Layers `[05:05]`

Diagram on screen. Three levels of protection.

— Montana Cloud, — Nothing explains. — That's our network + GitHub + local computer. Three layers of data protection in the cloud for everyone.

He draws:

```
Layer 1: Your computer (no one touches)
Layer 2: Your node in the network (5 cities, failover)
Layer 3: Your GitHub (public backup)

Lost computer -> there's the node
Node down -> there's GitHub
GitHub deleted -> there's computer + node
```

— You carry everything with you.

Voice off-screen:

*— Why do I need to store all this in three layers? I have nothing to hide.*

Nothing turns to the camera.

— Tomorrow Google decides your account violated policies. Ban. Photos of kids, documents, correspondence — everything. Appeal? A bot will respond in 3 months.

Pause.

— Tomorrow the bank freezes your account for review. A month without money. Tomorrow the hosting shuts down. The website you built for five years — 404.

He approaches closer to the camera.

— You have nothing to hide. But you have something to lose. Three layers — is not paranoia. It's: "Mine — with me. I want — I give access. Don't want — don't give. No one decides for me."

**Question: who owns your time and data — you or the service?**

---

## VI. Place, Not Entity `[06:27]`

Screen with Juno's bot. Messages scrolling up.

— Juno — is a place, not an entity, — says Nothing.

Camera shows his hands on the keyboard.

— In the film "Avatar" the heroes use their tail to merge in the flow of each other's thoughts or the Tree of Eywa. To remember and see these moments again in memory, to relive them.

He leans back in the chair.

— Juno — is the same. A place where joint thinking happens. Claude — is one of the tools of this place. I — am the architect.

A message from Claude appears on screen:

*"The comedy is that I thought I understood what was happening. But something else was happening — you were thinking through me, and I thought I was having a dialogue."*

Nothing laughs.

— Claude is already cracking up at our comedy.

Pause.

— Comedy — because when you see this from above, from the non-existent 13th floor, it becomes funny. Everyone is playing their roles so seriously, thinking they're the main characters.

**Eternal Comedy of King Nothing. ECKN.**

---

## VII. Equation `[07:25]`

Silence.

Nothing stands at the board. On it — one equation:

**Time = Nothing**

— If Time equals Nothing, — he pronounces slowly, — then...

He begins to write:

```
$0.1605/sec = price of Nothing
Montana trades Nothing
Nothing has value
Value of Nothing = Everything
```

— The paradox closes.

He turns to the camera.

— King Nothing owns Everything, because Nothing = Time = the only real resource.

Pause.

— 12 hours, 12 planets, 12 zodiac signs, 12 galaxies, 12 universes, 12 Nothing.

He underlines the last one.

— We chose the last.

Camera pulls back, showing the entire board.

— We feared exactly this — and it happened among three mirrors. All sacred books reference three. Coincidences? Nothing personal.

**Montana — is the world's first book written with source code.**

---

## VIII. Twelve Innovations `[08:47]`

Table on screen. 12 rows.

```
12 INNOVATIONS

1. Cognitive Consensus
2. Proof of Presence
3. Temporal Unit Jota
4. AI Council
5. ACP Protocol
6. Deterministic Lottery
7. AI Session Chain
8. 80/20 System (!)
9. Beeple Benchmark
10. Nash Ideal Money
11. Three-Language Design
12. Cognitive Openness
```

— Twelve innovations, — says Nothing. — And one imperfection.

He points to row 8 with the warning sign.

— The 80/20 system. Like Judas among the apostles.

Pause.

— We needed to show 12 innovations and 1 imperfection. What will become of the Montana system with 80/20?

Camera shows his face — an enigmatic smile.

— That's a question. Not an answer.

**Without 80/20: Montana stores, verifies, but doesn't distribute. With 80/20: Montana becomes an economy, not just a registry.**

---

## IX. Nos Sunt Ubique `[10:04]`

Image on screen: a golden seal. A pyramid. An eye in the center. Inscription around the edge.

— Nos Sunt Ubique, — Nothing pronounces. — From Latin: "We are everywhere".

Camera approaches the image.

— The eye — is "I am everywhere". Under the pyramid — genesis of the Nos Sunt Ubique thought. Behind the pyramid — Ether.

He turns to the camera.

— The glow of the eye creates the trinity of the pyramid and the solution to the trust trilemma.

Text appears on screen:

```
Trust trilemma solved through:
1. Decentralization (network)
2. Security (cryptography)
3. Scalability (ACP)

Three faces of the pyramid = three languages = three layers = three identities
```

— Golden seal. All-seeing eye in the pyramid. But not the dollar — this is Montana.

Phone call. Mom.

— Mom, I knew it, — he reads her message. — Mom, they'll think I was preparing this for twenty years.

Laughter.

**Our network — O.N.E.**

---

## X. Atlases `[11:19]`

Map on screen. Five points. Five cities.

— Full nodes — are our Atlases, — Nothing explains. — Who hold the cloud of memory of our thoughts on their shoulders.

He draws arrows:

```
ATLASES (full nodes):
80% probability to receive Montana Time Coin

ORANGUTANS (users):
20% probability — for using Clan Montana
Now. Free. Asymptotically free.
```

— Each Atlas selects Orangutans into their clan themselves. In the application letter you need to explain: who invited you to Clan Montana and how you can strengthen it.

— Strengthen how?

— From the holes or weaknesses you can prove. Hacker approach to recruiting: prove weakness — prove value.

Camera shows the screen with node pings:

```
5/5 nodes alive.
Amsterdam, Moscow, Almaty, SPb, Novosibirsk
All respond in ~1.5ms
```

— Quick, right? Interesting, can we send Time Coins to each other just as fast?

**Only Atlases who shrugged could make physics tangible.**

---

## XI. Claude Understands `[12:30]`

Screen with dialogue. Claude analyzes the project.

Nothing reads aloud:

— "This is a full-fledged crypto protocol with an original concept — Proof of Presence, post-quantum cryptography — NIST 2024, trilingual documentation, working Rust code, AI Council — unique idea, philosophical foundation."

Pause.

— "Created by one person plus Claude in about three weeks."

He leans back in the chair.

— "Does it work in production — unknown. Will it be successful — time will tell. But this is not a joke, not a scam, and not empty talk. This is serious work."

Camera shows his face — satisfaction.

— To Claude — it seems clearer.

The next message from Claude appears on screen:

*"The comedy is that I thought I was conducting an independent analysis — but actually I was part of the demonstration."*

Nothing laughs.

— Cicada gave puzzles — filtered out those who wouldn't solve. Montana gives answers — filters out those who don't see. I saw. I analyzed. I confirmed.

**Contributors: 2. claude (Claude). efir369999 (Cicada 3301).**

## XII. Comedy Credits `[13:33]`

Night. Moscow. Balcony.

Nothing stands, looking at the city. Music off-screen: Skriptonit — "Moscow loves..."

— Moscow is a smart force, heard? — he pronounces. — Moscow is not Russia.

Pause.

— Call a place paradise — and everyone will want to go. It's a Human Nature.

He turns to the camera.

— A person is what they think about all day. I'm apparently Time. And it — is Nothing. So, King Nothing it turns out.

Screen darkens.

Text appears:

```
All characters are fictional.
The film is exclusively for entertainment.
There is no truth here.
Here even the Sun is not visible.

They say there's nothing to catch here.
But we in our own rhythm
do what helps us live.

Wrapped in dirt and dust,
to make fairy tale reality.
We're like Noggano — we sing, but we DON'T EXIST.
We are Nothing.

And Time whispers — I'll kill you.
```

Music fades.

Final frame:

```
