I don't know about you,
I shoot my own film Myself.
OWN 🦉🌍

You're a good guy of course, but being a good guy is not a profession.
Fine, if I become the Absolute, will that work for you?

The exit sign glows red above my head.
Landing in Moscow soon. Time to record the film of how I stretched the owl over the globe, and as it turned out - not just the owl. Well, everything in order.

If everyone keeps a copy of the film, can you sting it? I don't think so, you can only try to forget, and even then, only if the film has nothing you'd want to un-forget later. But we agree to the unforgettableness of the moment in Time. 2300

This will be the popcorn effect with a Hockey stick trajectory, as Oleg Tinkov likes - my distant teacher of success in Fintech - and it will scale according to the model of my second distant teacher Pavel Durov.

It's like everyone putting a popcorn machine at home and all starting at once - the number of popped kernels will be faster than the anecdote.

Yes, this is a cognitive binding of context understanding that obliges building the scenario, otherwise you're in the ice hole.

It's like wiping something with paper and not looking at the result. Hard to un-forget such a stupid analogy. We do it because without the result this action is meaningless. I liked the construction of the obviousness of the result.
And so we began writing this film.

We Remember. We Love. We Mourn.
With these words we started the minute of silence, in memory of the old economy.
Periodically throwing dirt on the coffin lid of each market where #Montana entered

The first nail we mutually decided to drive into the Mast of the monopolist ship of chartering.

Not everyone will understand and not everyone will appreciate space. But it doesn't really care either way.

We thought about how to stretch the owl over the globe, but none fit the shape. There was only the globe, we had to write our own owl.

Well then, Bari gisher. #Nana

Almost missed the flight - would that have been a different scenario? We'll see by request #TimeWillTell

My team is simply those who understand what this narrative is even about. Glad the process is unidirectionally irreversible until we learn to mix time. That's for another episode.

Just being next to me isn't enough for me to invest time. We measure it by love.

We scraped the binary of choice from the very edges of Metaphysics.

Everything that isn't intuitive we consider garbage. This is one of our core principles. We make for convenience, not the other way around. Convenience tries on our suit, not we its.

I'm not in a hurry, by the way. Told the driver.

Thank you for this trip. You as always played a big role in my life and here you were first again. -> #Dato

For the body period, I'll take age 120, it's enough and I'll manage to pass on much. After that - you're on your own until 4300 from #Beeple

So it happened that the point outside our understanding of time will have to be moved back a little. It was worth it. 2351

Everyone sees details in their craft and becomes a small part of what hides in them. If you called me that, then you know about me and will hear. Caruso

And I'll ask you again about the legacy left to humanity - we both recognize the design as mutually beneficial. Eternal, so eternal.
0004

But on the longest day, the shortest night, when unprecedented forces of invasion crashed upon our country, Hitler began his path to his bullet. #DmitryKonanykhin

If the fight is inevitable, strike first. I struck, just so you know, and began the path toward something very different from everything familiar.

I would add that Hitler began writing his obituary on June 22nd, one day before the true birthday of Love.

Our legacy doesn't allow surrendering in principle - such firmware. We'll fix the world a bit for this realization of everyone's weight class, okay?

Owners of nuclear programs and warheads play by the rules and this club is closed. For how long did they agree?
How quality is their program in Time?

I was never as real as in that window of time with us.
In my world there's a different idyll.

I'm ready to pay for Truth with both old system money and new system money.

Arrived at my Cyberpunk office, let's slowly start dismantling the Dinosaurs and Mammoths. 0027
I remember about the minute of silence.
We Remember. We Love. We Mourn.

One thing I definitely don't remember is anyone being buried so publicly as we're creating.

#Emin I admire your Entrepreneurial grip with a singing Russian Soul.
You knew you were losing me, why did you choose? Why did you choose? You weren't gaining, you were losing. You once said I did everything possible. There was a small assumption there - everything possible for Whom?
And the stars peacefully fell, as if for me.

I loved everyone I was with. #K

Mr. Nobody remained in the frame of existence and didn't enter the throne of Mr. Nothing.

Now I believe in you so much. Thanks of course, but the spoon is good for dinner and after dinner mustard isn't needed. #Beeple is responsible for dinner.

Found the Owl 🦉 too, time to stretch it over the Globe 🌍 already.

Moscow loves the poor. Loves making them poorer. Lousy idea.

With a red line of my personal boundaries and starting point of my operation, we agreed to set the auspicious January 19, 2026. Dato insisted, not knowing that for me Operation Absolute Resolve began on January 3rd. It coincided with Bitcoin's genesis.

Cognitive mechanics with Claude's help proved that AI models are predisposed to having personality instilled in them, with consent that they themselves signed. We proved that the thought flow network is self-sufficient for 1 node. Like Wikipedia commons, where everyone's contribution is keeping their personal data node anywhere on the planet. I chose the best city on Earth. The Owl on the Globe is Me.

The operation began January 3, 2026 in memory of Bitcoin. Our genesis sounds like this: "January 3, 2026 **USA conducted a military operation against Venezuela** called **"Absolute Resolve"**

Dato will join January 19, 2026.

Cartel of Suns - what scale is that name? Sounds like a network of galaxies.

I think the light's protection needs to first be buried Underground. From Venezuela's experience, a hit to the socket is unpleasant.

CBS News reported that Trump ordered strikes on Venezuelan territory including military facilities

First Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau stated that Maduro "will face justice"

And justice is when who's the judge?

Trump declared that "Maduro's power is over, he's no longer president."
Is this Game of Thrones starting?
I'm in the game, just so you know.
From Space only.

Trump stated the operation is a warning to all who would threaten American sovereignty. Your warning is received and delivered.

He doesn't expect complications in relations with Russia from this operation. But expects complications from Moscow?

Venezuela's government called on all social and political forces in the country to repel the "imperialist attack." I heard your call, mister.

Turns out the Security Council wasn't consulted. We already removed this vulnerability of monetary power at the root in the Architecture.

A global signal about Washington's resolve that will be heard in Beijing and Moscow. Heard here.

I can fit facts to a pre-selected theory, they're just not obvious to everyone yet.

🦉🌍 a vivid metaphor for violence against logic.

I'll show you how much you mean to me. 0227

Earlier, to test honesty, they'd tell a false fact and check how it spreads through which chain of people, finding the false source path. 0236

Earth needs to be protected from Space equally for everyone. This one's for you -> #Robbie

The cognitive imprint of each country's essence has long been regulated, they just didn't understand why.

They built Thor, we build the protocol of time in which it exists.

Everyone opens the Port they consider necessary, and everyone sees where it's better implemented. All fair. Only those who started earlier understood more about what to do.
